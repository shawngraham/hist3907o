This workbook is made by converting several plain-text files into a fully-operational website using the 'mkdocs' \nstatic website generator\n. That means, if you want to keep a copy of all these files for your own records, you may. Simply click on the 'edit on github' link at the top right. This will bring you to the repository that houses this workbook. Then, when you're signed into 'github', you can 'fork' (that is, make a copy) the repo into your own account. Why 'forking'? It seems an odd phrase. Think of it like this:\n\n\nWriting, crafting, coding: these are like a small river, flowing in one direction into the future. You get new ideas, new hunches: the river branches. There's a fork in its path. Sometimes new ideas, new hunches fold back into that original stream: they merge. \n\n\nGithub is a way of mapping that stream, and a guide to revisiting the interesting parts of it.\n\n\nIt's not the best metaphor, but it'll do. No doubt you've had that experience where, after working on an essay for days, you make a change that you regret. You wish you could go back to fix it, but ctrl+z only goes so far. You realize that everything you've done for the last week needs to be thrown out, and you start over.\n\n\nWell, with 'versioning control', you can travel back upriver, back to where things were good. There are two tools that we will use to make this happen: \ngit\n and \ngithub\n. You'll learn more about making those things work in Module 1. You'll see why you'd want to do that, and how to keep an open notebook of your work on Github, writing things in a plain-text format called \n'markdown'\n. \n\n\nIn module 2, we'll start exploring the wide variety of historical data out there. We'll talk about some of the ethical dilemmas posed by having so much data out there. 'Data' are not neutral 'things given'; rather, they are 'capta': things \ntaken\n.\n\n\nIn module 3, we'll see that data/capta are \nmessy\n, and that they make a kind of illusory order that as historians, we are not normally in the habit of thinking about. The big secret of digital history is that the majority of your time on \nany\n digital history project won't be finding the capta, won't be analyzing the capta, won't be thinking about the historical meaning of the capta. We'll be \ncleaning it up\n. The exercises in this module will help you do that more efficiently (and be aware that 'efficiency' in computing terms is not a theoretically neutral idea!)\n\n\nWith module 4, we talk about doing the analysis. I present finding, cleaning, and analyzing as if they were sequential steps, but in reality they are circular. Movement in one aspect often requires revisting another one! This module explores how we do this, and what it means for us as historians.\n\n\nIn module 5, we begin at last to think about how we communicate all of this to our audiences. Look at how \none university lays out the expectations for digital history work\n (and, do you see how this ties back to ideas about \nparadata\n?). We will think about things like typography and layout. We'll look at ways of making our visualizations more compelling, more effective.\n\n\nFinally, while there is no formal requirement for you to do this, it would be a great way of launching yourself as a digital historian to think about how you would formally reveal your project work in this class to the wider world: and then do it. There's a lot of noise on the internet, especially when it comes to history.

            "text": "Module 1: Exercises\n\n\nAll 4 exercises are on this page. Remember to scroll!\n\n\nEXERCISE 1: learning markdown syntax with dillinger.io or prose.io\n\n\nHave you ever fought with Word or another wordprocessor, trying to get things just \nright\n? Word processing is a mess. It conflates writing with typesetting and layout. Sometimes, you just want to get the words out. Othertimes, you want to make your writing as accessible as possible... but your intended recipient can't open your file, because they don't use the same wordprocessor. Or perhaps you wrote up some great notes that you'd love to have in a slideshow; but you can't, because copying and pasting preserves a whole lot of extra \ngunk\n that messes up your materials.\n\n\nThe answer is to separate your \ncontent\n from your tool:\n\n\nThis is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles, sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least, your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor you are currently using stops working or \u201cgoes out of business.\u201d\n\n\nWriting in this way liberates the author from the tool. Markdown can be written in any plain text editor and offers a rich ecosystem of software that can render that text into beautiful looking documents. For this reason, Markdown is currently enjoying a period of growth, not just as as means for writing scholarly papers but as a convention for online editing in general.\n\n\nPopular general purpose plain text editors include TextWrangler and Sublime for Mac, Notepad++ for Windows, as well as Gedit and Kate for Linux. However, there are also editors that specialize in displaying and editing Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nTenen and Wythoff, \nSustainable Authorship in Plain Text Using Pandoc and Markdown\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, I want you to become familiar with Markdown syntax. There are a number of 'flavours' for Markdown, but in essence, they all mimic the kinds of conventions you would see in an email, using asterisks to indicate emphasis and so on. \n\n\n\n\nYou will need this \ncheatsheet\n. \n\n\nGo to \ndillinger.io\n in a new browser window. This looks like a wordprocessor. The left hand side of the screen is where you write, the right hand side shows you what your text will look like. Dillinger 'saves' your work in your browser's memory. You can also point it to save to your dropbox, google drive, or github account (under the cogwheel icon. Do you have a dropbox etc account? You should set that up now, if you don't).\n\n\nWrite a short 200-500 word piece on why you are taking this class; what you hope to achieve here; the kind of digital experience you already have versus the kind of experience you wish to have.\n\n\nHave at least two images (creative commons licensed for re-use - do you know how to find these?) and link outwards to four websites that are relevant to your piece.\n\n\nIn the 'document name' slot, make sure to add the file type .md at the end\n\n\n'Save to' your dropbox, github, google drive, or one drive account.\n\n\n\n\nSee how easy that was? Don't worry about submitting this.... yet.\n\n\n\n\nnb: the next time you go to dillinger.io the last document you were working on will load up. That's because dillinger stashes your work in the browser cache. If you clear your cache (from your browser's tools or settings) you'll lose it, which is why in step 6 I suggested saving to those various accounts.\n\n\n\n\nEXERCISE 2: setting up your github space\n\n\nIn this exercise, you will 1. get an account on github; 2. download and install git \n the github desktop program; 3. setup a webpage using the gh-pages branch for a repo\n\n\n\n\nGet an account with github: \nGithub\n\n\nGet the desktop 'gui' (graphical user interface; a program) for github \nhere\n\n\nWork your way through the material below:\n\n\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\n\n\ngit is a program that keeps snapshots of the contents of a designated folder; it watches for 'difs' or differences between one snapshot and the next.\n\n\ngithub\n is a webservice that allows you to keep track of those \nversions\n online, and what's more, to share those files with multiple collaborators, and \nkeep everyone's changes straight!\n\n\n\n\nSome key terms:\n\n\n\n\nrepository\n: a single folder that holds all of the files and subfolders of your project\n\n\ncommit\n: this means, 'take a snapshot of the current state of my repostiory'\n\n\npublish\n: take my folder on my computer, and copy it and its contents to the web as a repository at github.com/myusername/repositoryname\n\n\nsync\n: update the web repository with the latest commit from my local folder\n\n\nbranch\n: make a copy of my repository with a 'working name'\n\n\nmerge\n: fold the changes I have made on a branch into another branch (typically, either \nmaster\n or \ngh-pages\n)\n\n\nfork\n: to make a copy of someone else's repo\n\n\nclone\n: to copy a repo online onto your own computer\n\n\npull\n request: to ask the original maker of a repo to 'pull' your changes into their master, original, repository\n\n\npush\n: to move your changes from your computer to the online repo\n\n\n\n\nThe historian Jack Dougherty has an excellent video and step-by-step instructions for getting set up with git and github. Please \nread his steps\n and then watch his video:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: Dougherty's step 4 - he's copied and pasted the embed code from an interactive chart from Google Sheets. I want you instead to paste the embed code from a youtube video that captures something essential about yourself into the new file \nindex.html\n. ALSO, make sure your repo/folder is called \ndemo\n the way Dougherty's is.\n\n\nDon't worry about submitting all this... yet.\n\n\n\n\nnb here are some more resources about git and github -\nGithub Guides\n this explain in more depth some of the concepts behind Github. You could also try this tutorial, but it's not mandatory: \ntrygit\n. This tutorial emulates using the version control software git itself (upon which Github is built) from the command line. Some more tutorials and resources\nhere\n and \nhere\n).\n\n\n\n\nEXERCISE 3: setting up a simple open notebook (blog + personal github repo + notational velocity or notation, as appropriate)\n\n\nIn this exercise, you will create a new repository, and then set up your note taking software so that it saves your notes into your repository. This allows you to keep track of changes to your notes, and also to have an open backup online. An online version of your notes allows others to contribute to, and build from, your research! When people 'fork' or copy your repository, you can consider that a form of citation, as well. There are other benefits; we can chat about these.\n\n\n\n\nThe essence of an open notebook is a) it's easy to update b) it is under version control c) it's open and can be viewed/share online. We do this by storing notes from our notetaking software in a folder on our computer \nwhich is also a repository that your github desktop software monitors.\n Periodically, you will make 'commits' and 'sync' your local folder with the online version.\n\n\nFirst, let's set up the folder/repository. We do this by going to github.com and logging in. Then, follow these \ndetailed instructions to create a new repository\n. Call it 'my research notebook' or something similar. The github website will ask you if wish to initialize your repository with a readme.me file. Say 'yes'.\n\n\nIn your github interface on your computer (the desktop gui), select 'syncronize'. The repository you just created online is now on your computer (it will be a folder inside your github folder). Challenge: can you locate this folder? \n\n\nDownload and set up Notational Velocity Alt (nvAlt) \n(Mac)\n or ResophNotes \n(PC)\n. \n    a. In \nnotational velocity\n you can change the settings so that each note is its own plain text file, and you can change the location where notational velocity saves. Go to preferences \n notes \n storage. Under 'recognize individual files with attributes' there are two lists. Hit the \n+\n under each list and add \nmd\n. Then highlight all the other file extensions and hit \n-\n in turn. Under \nread notes from folder\n select the location of the folder/repository you created in the previous step. (A quick guide for nvAlt lives \nhere\n) \n    b. For \nResophNotes\n, click on the cogwheel icon at the bottom right. Then select the storage tab. Tick the 'plain text file' radio button, and the 'save title in text file' option. Then, in 'file directory', change the path to your open notebook repository. Then click ok. Under 'options' click the 'enable markdown' radiobox. (A quick guide to Resophnotes lives \nhere\n)\n\n\n\n\nYou now have a system in place for quickly taking notes, and for archiving them online on github. Let's take some notes. \n At this point, please put the piece you wrote for exercise 1 - the markdown version - into a new note in your notetaking software set up in the preceeding step. Then, make a new note with the direct URL to the demo repository you created in exercise 2. \n\n\nLet's take a moment and think about how you take notes. Knowing that this software searches the titles of your notes, you might like to figure out a system for grouping notes in the title. I will create a new 'to read' note for instance by titling it  \n.xtoread The Information James Gleick\n \n\n\nThe bit with the \n.toread\n can be thought of as a tag. I'm not likely to use that particular pattern of letters anywhere else, so it makes a good tag to search on. Then, when I want to know what it is I have under that tag, I just type into the search field .xtoread and I get all my notes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of five tags you would often use in your research. Then, I would like you to make ten notes on this keynote by Tim Hitchock, \nBig Data For Dead People\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've finished your notes (summarize! don't copy out text! include some bibliography in every note, so you know where your thoughts came from! you can copy your notes into your essay drafts as part of your writing if you've used summaries!) open your github software. It will now be showing that changes have happened in your repository. Commit the changes, then synchronize. Remember: you have to leave a message in the 'commit summary' box in order to commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your repository online. Refresh the page. Your notes are now online. The final step is the 'narrative' of your notetaking. I often make blog posts to remind myself of what I was doing, what I was thinking, and to gather together links to useful resources etc. The narrative part of your open notebook ecology could be done as a new note, or a blog post. Your choice. Explain your tagging system, and link to your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostscript to this exercise\n Read James Baker's piece on \n'Preserving Your Research Data'\n and, when you come to start working on your final project, see if you can apply his lessons to organizing your research.\n\n\nEXERCISE 4: forking \n contributing to a repository\n\n\nIn this exercise, I would like you to \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFork the \n'who-we-are'\n repo for this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename the \ntemplate.md\n file with \nyourname\n.md\n. Change the file accordingly to edit in your name, and the location of your online HQ \n open notebook as properly formatted markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n before you start \n Now, when we're writing files from scratch (as opposed to making notes) you will need a good text editor. If you're on a Mac, you might already have something like TextWrangler. If you're on Windows, you're out of luck (notepad and wordpad are not useful to us; you can ask me why). A good text editor that works on both Mac and Windows is \nSublime Text\n. This is free, though you will be reminded periodically to purchase a license to support development. If you find yourself using it a lot, you should. \n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nIt is possible to build a website with a single command from your open notebook markdown formatted pages. I use something called 'pykwiki' to generate my own \nopen notebook\n. Are you familiar with blogs? Blogs work by using a series of templates that dictate the look of the website, while dynamically building the website fresh each time some one visits (content is pulled out of a database). This is cool, but it can be hacked; it can be slow; and it puts a strain on computing resources. A website like my open notebook is generated by me, with a single command, whenever I want to update it. The version that lives online is just a series of static html pages: no dynamic loading, no vulnerabilities, easy to search, easy to archive, easy to share. \n\n\nYou can try this out for yourself. If you're on a mac, you have the python programming language already installed. If you're on windows, you'll need to install it. Go on, I'll wait.\n\n\nThen, install \nmk-docs\n (\ninstructions here\n). Since you already have a repository, navigate to it via your terminal or command line. Follow the instructions on that page to generate your site. Then, there's one command that will push your entire site to the \ngh-pages\n branch of your repository \ninstructions here\n. Ta da!\n\n\nNow, you might run into hiccups, depending on how your system is set up. That's why this part of the exercises is called 'advanced'. See if you can solve them. Re-write this exercise with all the tacit bits spelt out - put it into your open notebook. Often, a major part of being a 'digital humanist' is uncovering all the tacit bits of how our digital tools are affecting our lives...\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nNow that you've worked through all of that, I can tell you that there are many different ways you could approach the problem of making your research notes publically available. You could connect dillinger.io or prose.io directly to your github accounts, and always make your notes that way. The advantage of notational velocity and resophnotes is that search \n note creation happen at the same time. There are also more features in both programs that let you cross-reference notes and so on. The key is to figure out a solution that works for you, \nand\n that lets you make your research open. 'What if I get scooped?' I hear you say. Well, let's talk about what \nCaleb McDaniel has to say\n. And we should also talk about the \nsmallest federated wiki\n.",

            "text": "Have you ever fought with Word or another wordprocessor, trying to get things just  right ? Word processing is a mess. It conflates writing with typesetting and layout. Sometimes, you just want to get the words out. Othertimes, you want to make your writing as accessible as possible... but your intended recipient can't open your file, because they don't use the same wordprocessor. Or perhaps you wrote up some great notes that you'd love to have in a slideshow; but you can't, because copying and pasting preserves a whole lot of extra  gunk  that messes up your materials.  The answer is to separate your  content  from your tool:  This is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles, sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least, your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor you are currently using stops working or \u201cgoes out of business.\u201d  Writing in this way liberates the author from the tool. Markdown can be written in any plain text editor and offers a rich ecosystem of software that can render that text into beautiful looking documents. For this reason, Markdown is currently enjoying a period of growth, not just as as means for writing scholarly papers but as a convention for online editing in general.  Popular general purpose plain text editors include TextWrangler and Sublime for Mac, Notepad++ for Windows, as well as Gedit and Kate for Linux. However, there are also editors that specialize in displaying and editing Markdown.   Tenen and Wythoff,  Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text Using Pandoc and Markdown   In this exercise, I want you to become familiar with Markdown syntax. There are a number of 'flavours' for Markdown, but in essence, they all mimic the kinds of conventions you would see in an email, using asterisks to indicate emphasis and so on.    You will need this  cheatsheet .   Go to  dillinger.io  in a new browser window. This looks like a wordprocessor. The left hand side of the screen is where you write, the right hand side shows you what your text will look like. Dillinger 'saves' your work in your browser's memory. You can also point it to save to your dropbox, google drive, or github account (under the cogwheel icon. Do you have a dropbox etc account? You should set that up now, if you don't).  Write a short 200-500 word piece on why you are taking this class; what you hope to achieve here; the kind of digital experience you already have versus the kind of experience you wish to have.  Have at least two images (creative commons licensed for re-use - do you know how to find these?) and link outwards to four websites that are relevant to your piece.  In the 'document name' slot, make sure to add the file type .md at the end  'Save to' your dropbox, github, google drive, or one drive account.   See how easy that was? Don't worry about submitting this.... yet.   nb: the next time you go to dillinger.io the last document you were working on will load up. That's because dillinger stashes your work in the browser cache. If you clear your cache (from your browser's tools or settings) you'll lose it, which is why in step 6 I suggested saving to those various accounts.",

            "text": "In this exercise, you will create a new repository, and then set up your note taking software so that it saves your notes into your repository. This allows you to keep track of changes to your notes, and also to have an open backup online. An online version of your notes allows others to contribute to, and build from, your research! When people 'fork' or copy your repository, you can consider that a form of citation, as well. There are other benefits; we can chat about these.   The essence of an open notebook is a) it's easy to update b) it is under version control c) it's open and can be viewed/share online. We do this by storing notes from our notetaking software in a folder on our computer  which is also a repository that your github desktop software monitors.  Periodically, you will make 'commits' and 'sync' your local folder with the online version.  First, let's set up the folder/repository. We do this by going to github.com and logging in. Then, follow these  detailed instructions to create a new repository . Call it 'my research notebook' or something similar. The github website will ask you if wish to initialize your repository with a readme.me file. Say 'yes'.  In your github interface on your computer (the desktop gui), select 'syncronize'. The repository you just created online is now on your computer (it will be a folder inside your github folder). Challenge: can you locate this folder?   Download and set up Notational Velocity Alt (nvAlt)  (Mac)  or ResophNotes  (PC) . \n    a. In  notational velocity  you can change the settings so that each note is its own plain text file, and you can change the location where notational velocity saves. Go to preferences   notes   storage. Under 'recognize individual files with attributes' there are two lists. Hit the  +  under each list and add  md . Then highlight all the other file extensions and hit  -  in turn. Under  read notes from folder  select the location of the folder/repository you created in the previous step. (A quick guide for nvAlt lives  here ) \n    b. For  ResophNotes , click on the cogwheel icon at the bottom right. Then select the storage tab. Tick the 'plain text file' radio button, and the 'save title in text file' option. Then, in 'file directory', change the path to your open notebook repository. Then click ok. Under 'options' click the 'enable markdown' radiobox. (A quick guide to Resophnotes lives  here )   You now have a system in place for quickly taking notes, and for archiving them online on github. Let's take some notes.   At this point, please put the piece you wrote for exercise 1 - the markdown version - into a new note in your notetaking software set up in the preceeding step. Then, make a new note with the direct URL to the demo repository you created in exercise 2.   Let's take a moment and think about how you take notes. Knowing that this software searches the titles of your notes, you might like to figure out a system for grouping notes in the title. I will create a new 'to read' note for instance by titling it   .xtoread The Information James Gleick    The bit with the  .toread  can be thought of as a tag. I'm not likely to use that particular pattern of letters anywhere else, so it makes a good tag to search on. Then, when I want to know what it is I have under that tag, I just type into the search field .xtoread and I get all my notes.     Think of five tags you would often use in your research. Then, I would like you to make ten notes on this keynote by Tim Hitchock,  Big Data For Dead People      Once you've finished your notes (summarize! don't copy out text! include some bibliography in every note, so you know where your thoughts came from! you can copy your notes into your essay drafts as part of your writing if you've used summaries!) open your github software.

If you have difficulties, or if the instructions need clarification, please click the 'issues' button and leave a note. Feel free to fork and improve these instructions, if you are so inclined. Remember, these exercises get progressively more difficult, and will require you to either download materials or read materials on other websites. Give yourself plenty of time. Try them all, and remember you can turn to (I encourage you to!) your classmates for help. Work together!\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nWhere do we go to find data? Part of that problem is solved by knowing what question you are asking, and what \nkinds\n of data would help solve that question. Let's assume that you have a pretty good question you want an answer to - say, something concerning social and household history in early Ottawa, like what was the role of 'corner' stores (if such things exist?) in fostering a sense of neighbourhood - and begin thinking about how you'd find data to explore that question. \n\n\nIan Milligan\n recently gave a \nworkshop on these issues\n. He identifies a few different ways by which you might obtain your data, and we will follow him closely as we look at:\n\n\n\n\nThe Dream Case\n\n\nScraping Data yourself with free software (Outwit Hub)\n\n\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n\n\nWget\n\n\n\n\nThere is so much data available; with these methods, we can gather enormous amounts that will let us see large-scale macroscopic patterns. At the same time, it allows us to dive into the details with comparative ease. The thing is, not all digital data are created equally. Google has spent millions digitizing \neverything\n; newspapers have digitized their own collections. Genealogists and local historical societies upload yoinks of digitized photographs, wills, local tax records, \nyou-name-it\n, \nevery day\n. But, consider what Milligan has to say about \n'illusionary order'\n:\n\n\n\n\n[...] poor and misunderstood use of online newspapers can skew historical research. In a conference presentation or a lecture, it\u2019s not uknown to see the familiar yellow highlighting of found searchwords on projected images: indicative of how the original primary material was obtained. But this historical approach generally usually remains unspoken, without a critical methodological reflection. As I hope I\u2019ll show here, using Pages of the Past uncritically for historical research is akin to using a volume of the Canadian Historical Review with 10% or so of the pages ripped out. Historians, journalists, policy researchers, genealogists, and amateur researchers need to at least have a basic understanding of what goes on behind the black box.\n\n\n\n\nPlease go and read that full article. You should makes some notes: what are some of the key dangers? Reflect: how have you used digitized resources uncritically in the past?\n\n\n\n\nRemember: 'To digitize' doesn't - or shouldn't - mean uploading a photograph of a document. There's a lot more going on that that. We'll get to that in a moment.\n\n\nExercise 1: The Dream Case\n\n\nIn the dream case, your data are not just images, but are actually sorted and structured into some kind of pre-existing database. There are choices made in the \ncreation\n of the database, but a good database, a good project, will lay out for you their decision making, their corpora, and how they've dealt with ambiguity and so on. You search using a robust interface, and you get a well-formed spreadsheet of data in return. Two examples of 'dream case' data:\n\n\n\n\nEpigraphic Database Heidelberg\n\n\nCommwealth War Graves Commission, Find War Dead\n\n\n\n\nExplore both databases. Perform a search of interest to you. In the case of the epigraphic database, if you've done any Latin, try searching for terms related to occupations; or you could search '\nFiglin*\n'. In the CWGC database, search your own surname. Download your results. You now have data that you can explore! In your online research notebook, make a record (or records) of what you searched, the URL for your search \n its results, and where you're keeping your data. \n\n\nExercise 2: Outwit Hub\n\n\nDownload, and install, \noutwit hub\n. Do not buy it (not unless you really want to; the free trial is good enough for our purposes here)\n\n\nOutwit hub is a piece of software that lets you scrape the html of a webpage. It comes with its own browser. In essence, you look at the html source code of your page to identify the \nmarkers\n that embrace the information you want. Outwit then copies just that information into a table for you, which you can then download. Take a look at the \nSuda Online\n and do a search for 'pie' (the Suda is a 10th century Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, and its online version is one of the earliest examples of what we'd now recognize as digital humanities scholarship). \n\n\nRight-click anywhere on the results page, and 'view source'. You'll see something like this:\n\n\nThe record number - the Adler number - is very clearly marked, as is the translation. Those are the bits we want. So\n\n\nOpen outwit hub. Copy and paste the search URL into the Outwit hub address bar:\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page - that's where you tell Outwit how to scrape that source.  Click \u2018scrapers,\u2019 then \u2018new,\u2019 give it a name. Enter the markers that you are interested in:\n\n\n\nHit Execute to run the scraper. Press \u2018Catch\u2019 to move it into your memory. Press 'export' to generate (and save) a spreadsheet of your data.\n\n\nWrite this exercise up in your notebook. What other data does outwit include with your export? How might that data be useful?\n\n\nExercise 3: APIs\n\n\nSometimes, a website will have what is called an 'application programming interface'. In essence, this lets a program on your computer talk to the computer serving the website you're interested in, such that the website gives you the data that you're looking for.\n\n\nThat is, instead of \nyou\n punching in the search terms, and copying and pasting the results, you get the computer to do it. More or less. The thing is, the results come back to you in a machine-readable format - often, JSON, which is a kind of text format. It looks like this:\n\n\n\nThe 'Canadiana Discovery Portal' has tonnes of materials related to Canada's history, from a wide variety of sources. Its search page is at: http://search.canadiana.ca/\n\n\n\n\nGo there, and search \"ottawa\" and set the date range to 1800 to 1900. Hit enter. You are presented with a page of results -56 249 results! That's a lot of data. But do you notice the address bar of your browser? It'll say something like this:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://search.canadiana.ca/search?q=ottawa\nfield=\ndf=1800\ndt=1900\n\n\nYour search query has been put into the URL. You're looking at the API! Everything after /search is a command that you are sending to the Canadiana server.\n\n\nScroll through the results, and you'll see a number just before the ?\n\n\nhttp://search.canadiana.ca/search/2?df=1800\ndt=1900\nq=ottawa\nfield=\n\n\nhttp://search.canadiana.ca/search/3?df=1800\ndt=1900\nq=ottawa\nfield=\n\n\nhttp://search.canadiana.ca/search/4?df=1800\ndt=1900\nq=ottawa\nfield=\n\n\n....all the way up to 5625 (ie, 10 results per page, so 56249 / 10).\n\n\nIf you go to http://search.canadiana.ca/support/api you can see the full list of options. What we are particularly interested in now is the bit that looks like this:\n\n\nfmt=json\n\n\nAdd that to your query URL. How different the results now look! What's nice here is that the data is formatted in a way that makes sense to a machine - which we'll learn more about in due course.\n\n\nIf you look back at the full list of API options, you'll see at the bottom that one of the options is 'retrieving individual item records'; the key for that is a field called 'oocihm'. If you look at your page of json results, and scroll through them, you'll see that each individual record has its own oocihm number. If we could get a list of those, we'd be able to programmatically slot them into the commands for retrieving individual item records:\n\n\nhttp://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.16278/?r=0\ns=1\nfmt=json\napi_text=1\n\n\nThe problem is: how to retrieve those oocihm numbers. The answer is, 'we write a program'. And the program that you want can be \nfound here\n. Study that program carefully. There are a number of useful things happening in there, notably 'curl', 'jq', 'sed', 'awk'. curl  is a program for downloading webpages, jq for dealing with json, and sed and awk for searching within and cleaning up text. If this all sounds greek to you, there is an excellent gentle introduction over at \nWilliam Turkel's blog\n.\n\n\nI've put a copy \nin the module 2 repository, to save you the trouble.\n\n\nMac instructions:\n\n\nFirst question: do you have wget installed on your computer? If you don't, you'll need it for this exercise and the next one (if you look in the program 'api-ex-mac.sh', you'll see that the final line of the program asks wget to go get the results you've scraped from Canadiana). Installing wget is quite straightforward - follow \nthe Programming Historian's instructions\n.\n\n\nOur program requires a helper program that reads the .json data - It's called JQ. You can install this by using HOMEBREW. But to install homebrew, visit \nhttp://brew.sh\n and follow instructions. Then, to install jq, type \nbrew install jq\n from your terminal.\n\n\nNow, download api-ex-mac.sh from the repository and save it to your desktop. Open your terminal program (which you can find under 'applications' and then 'utilities'.) Navigate to your desktop:\n\n\ncd desktop\n\n\nthen tell your computer that this 'api-ex-mac.sh' program is one that you want to run:\n\n\nsudo chmod 700 file.sh\n\n\nAnd then you can run it by typing:\n\n\n./api-ex-mac.sh\n  but \ndon't\n do that yet! You'll need to change the search parameters to reflect your own interests. Do you see how you can do that? Open the program in a text editor, make the relevant change, save with a new name, and then run the new command. Move your results into a sensible location on your computer. Make a new entry (or entries) into your research notebook about this process, what worked, what hasn't, what you've found, where things are, and so on. You might want to upload your script (your .sh file) to your repository. Remember: the goal is so that you can come back to all this in a month's time and figure out \nexactly what you did\n to collect your data. \n\n\nWindows7\n8 instructions:\n\n\nBegin by making a folder for this exercise on your desktop.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need \ngitbash\n (which comes with git; I know you already have github on your desktop, which has \ngit shell\n but that's not what we want. Download \ngit\n and install it, and that will give you the git bash utility, and will not mess with your github set up. 'Bash' is  \"a shell that runs commands once you type the name of a command and press \n on your keyboard.\" You can see screenshots and find help on all this \nhere\n. You will be running our scraper program from within this shell.\n\n\nYou'll need jq \ndownload here\n. You're going to put this in the folder you've made for this exercise.\n\n\nYou'll need CoreUtils \nfrom here\n. Download and install this.\n\n\nYou need to tell your computer that CoreUtils now exists on your machine. Go to your computer's control panel. On 'my computer' (or whatever Windows calls it these days) right click and select 'properties'. Then select 'advanced'.\n\n\nClick on the 'environment variables' button.\n\n\nIn the pop-up box that opens, there is a box marked 'system variables'. Highlight the one called 'Path'. Click on 'Edit'.\n\n\nIn the variable box that you can now edit, there should already be many things. Scroll to the very end of that (to the right) and add:\n\n\n\n\n;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin\n\n\n+nb: make sure there's a space between files and (x86).\n\n\n...so yes, start that with a semicolon- and what you are putting in is the exact location of where the coreutils package of programs is located.\n\n\nFinally, you'll need wget installed on your machine. Get it \nhere\n and download it to C:Windows directory.\n\n\nNow:\n\n- download api-ex-pc.sh from our \nrepository\n\n- open \ngit bash\n - it'll be available via your programs menu. You do not want 'Git Gui' nor 'GitHub' nor 'Git Shell'. \nGit bash\n. \n- inside git bash, you change directory so that you are working within the folder you made on your desktop. The command to change directory is \ncd\n  ie \ncd course-notes\n would go one level down into a folder called 'course notes'. To go one level up, you'd type \ncd ..\n \n- ie, two periods. More help on finding your way around this interface is \nhere\n\n- Once you're in the right folder, all you have to do is type the name of our programme: \napi-ex-pc.sh\n and your program will query the Canadiana API, save the results, and then use wget to retrieve the full text of each result by asking the API for those results in turn. \nBut don't do that yet!\n \n\n\nYou'll need to change the search parameters to reflect your own interests. Do you see how you can do that? Open the program in a text editor, make the relevant change, save with a new name (make sure to keep the same file extenion, \n.sh\n - in notepad, change the save as file type to \nall files\n and then write the new name, e.g, \napi-ex-pc-2.sh\n, and then run your program by typing its name at the prompt in the git bash window. When it's finished, move your results into a sensible location on your computer. Make a new entry (or entries) into your research notebook about this process, what worked, what hasn't, what you've found, where things are, and so on. You might want to upload your script (your .sh file) to your repository. Remember: the goal is so that you can come back to all this in a month's time and figure out \nexactly what you did\n to collect your data. \n\n\nAn alternative Windows installation\n\n\nThis can also work for Windows 7 \nif\n you've got powershell 3 installed. Win7 comes with an earlier version, so you'd have to update it, \nwhich isn't straightforward\n. I'm grateful to \nDenis Gladkikh for his blog post on the matter\n._\n\n\n\n\nMake a folder somewhere handy for this exercise. Download the \napi-ex-pc.sh\n program into it, as well as \njq\n\n\nFind, and run, 'Powershell'\n\n\nAt the prompt, type in these commands in sequence:\n\n\n\n\nset-executionpolicy unrestricted -s cu\n\n\nSay 'yes' at the prompt that asks if you really want to do this.\n\n\niex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')\n\n\nscoop install 7zip coreutils curl git grep openssh sed wget vim grep\n\n\nA number of components will download and get configured to work from within powershell. When they finish, at the command prompt, you can run your program like so:\n\n\n./api-ex-pc.sh\n\n\nIf all goes well A new window will pop open, and you'll be downloading material from Canadiana! You can close that window where the downloading is happening to stop the process. If you open your program, you can adjust it to search for your own requests \nsee this discussion for hints on how to do this\n\n\nYou've got a pretty powerful tool now for grabbing data from one of the largest portals for Canadian history!\n\n\nJust remember to move your results from your folder before running a new search.\n\n\nWget\n\n\nFinally, we can use wget to retrieve data in cases where there is no API. If you look carefully at the program in exercise 3, you'll see we used the wget command. In this exercise, we search for a collection in the internet archive, grab all of the file identifiers, and feed these into wget \nfrom the command line or terminal\n. One command, thousands of documents!\n\n\n(If you skipped the previous exercise, you need to install wget. Go to \nthe programming historian tutorial on wget\n and follow the relevant instructions (depending on your operating system) to install it.)\n\n\nThis section will follow \nMilligan p52-64\n. I am not going to spell out the steps this time; I want you to carefully peruse Milligan's presentation, and see if you can follow along (pgs 52-64: he uses wget plus a text file so that wget auto-completes the URLs and scrapes the data found there - much like the final line of the program in exercise 3). There will often be cases where you want to do something, and you find someone's presentations or notes which \nalmost\n tell you everything you need to know. Alternatively, you can complete the tutorial from the \nProgramming historian\n for this exercise. In either case, keep notes on what you've done, what works, where the problems seem to lie, what the tacit knowledge is that isn't made clear (ie, are there assumptions being made in the tutorial or the presentation that are opaque to you?). \n\n\nhints:\n\n\n\n\nremember that wget is run from your terminal (Mac) or command line (PC). Do you know where to find these?\n\n\nif you're working on a mac, when you get to the point that Milligan directs you to save the search results file (which came as csv) as a .txt file, you need to select the unicode-16 txt file option.\n\n\nthe wget command is \nwget -r -H -nc -np -nH --cut-dirs=2 -A .txt -e robots=off -l1 -i ./itemlist.txt -B 'http://archive.org/download/'\n\n\nto make sure everything is working, perhaps make a copy of your itemlist.txt file with only ten or so items in it. Call it 'itemlist-short.txt' and put that in the command. That way, if there are errors, you'll find out sooner rather than later!\n\n\nYou might want to make a note in your notebook about what all those 'flags' in the command are doing. \nHere's the wget manual\n\n\nOnce it starts working, you might see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nbut\n if that's all you get, and nothing downloads, the problem is in your txt file. \nMake sure\n to create your txt file with a text editor (textwrangler, sublime text, notepad) and \nnot\n from \nsave as...txt\n in excel. (If you have an option when you create the text file, make sure the encoding is 'utf-8' rather than 'utf-16').\n- if you're really stuck, see this \nblog post from the Internet Archive\n\n\nGoing Further\n\n\n\n\nuse Ed Summer's \nTWARC\n to grab, archive, share, inflate, and visualize tweets\n\n\nconvert JSON to CSV with \nthis tool\n\n\nuse R to grab resources from \ndp.la\n with this wee R script on my \ngists\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\n\nyou can drop geojson into github, and \ngithub will turn it into a map\n\n\ntwarc can be used to extract the coordinates from tweets, and turn them into geojson data.",

Let's assume that you have a pretty good question you want an answer to - say, something concerning social and household history in early Ottawa, like what was the role of 'corner' stores (if such things exist?) in fostering a sense of neighbourhood - and begin thinking about how you'd find data to explore that question.   Ian Milligan  recently gave a  workshop on these issues . He identifies a few different ways by which you might obtain your data, and we will follow him closely as we look at:   The Dream Case  Scraping Data yourself with free software (Outwit Hub)  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  Wget   There is so much data available; with these methods, we can gather enormous amounts that will let us see large-scale macroscopic patterns. At the same time, it allows us to dive into the details with comparative ease. The thing is, not all digital data are created equally. Google has spent millions digitizing  everything ; newspapers have digitized their own collections. Genealogists and local historical societies upload yoinks of digitized photographs, wills, local tax records,  you-name-it ,  every day . But, consider what Milligan has to say about  'illusionary order' :   [...] poor and misunderstood use of online newspapers can skew historical research. In a conference presentation or a lecture, it\u2019s not uknown to see the familiar yellow highlighting of found searchwords on projected images: indicative of how the original primary material was obtained. But this historical approach generally usually remains unspoken, without a critical methodological reflection. As I hope I\u2019ll show here, using Pages of the Past uncritically for historical research is akin to using a volume of the Canadian Historical Review with 10% or so of the pages ripped out. Historians, journalists, policy researchers, genealogists, and amateur researchers need to at least have a basic understanding of what goes on behind the black box.   Please go and read that full article. You should makes some notes: what are some of the key dangers? Reflect: how have you used digitized resources uncritically in the past?

The command to change directory is  cd   ie  cd course-notes  would go one level down into a folder called 'course notes'. To go one level up, you'd type  cd ..   - ie, two periods. More help on finding your way around this interface is  here \n- Once you're in the right folder, all you have to do is type the name of our programme:  api-ex-pc.sh  and your program will query the Canadiana API, save the results, and then use wget to retrieve the full text of each result by asking the API for those results in turn.  But don't do that yet!    You'll need to change the search parameters to reflect your own interests. Do you see how you can do that? Open the program in a text editor, make the relevant change, save with a new name (make sure to keep the same file extenion,  .sh  - in notepad, change the save as file type to  all files  and then write the new name, e.g,  api-ex-pc-2.sh , and then run your program by typing its name at the prompt in the git bash window. When it's finished, move your results into a sensible location on your computer. Make a new entry (or entries) into your research notebook about this process, what worked, what hasn't, what you've found, where things are, and so on. You might want to upload your script (your .sh file) to your repository. Remember: the goal is so that you can come back to all this in a month's time and figure out  exactly what you did  to collect your data.   An alternative Windows installation  This can also work for Windows 7  if  you've got powershell 3 installed. Win7 comes with an earlier version, so you'd have to update it,  which isn't straightforward . I'm grateful to  Denis Gladkikh for his blog post on the matter ._   Make a folder somewhere handy for this exercise. Download the  api-ex-pc.sh  program into it, as well as  jq  Find, and run, 'Powershell'  At the prompt, type in these commands in sequence:   set-executionpolicy unrestricted -s cu  Say 'yes' at the prompt that asks if you really want to do this.  iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')  scoop install 7zip coreutils curl git grep openssh sed wget vim grep  A number of components will download and get configured to work from within powershell. When they finish, at the command prompt, you can run your program like so:  ./api-ex-pc.sh  If all goes well A new window will pop open, and you'll be downloading material from Canadiana! You can close that window where the downloading is happening to stop the process. If you open your program, you can adjust it to search for your own requests  see this discussion for hints on how to do this  You've got a pretty powerful tool now for grabbing data from one of the largest portals for Canadian history!  Just remember to move your results from your folder before running a new search.",

            "text": "Finally, we can use wget to retrieve data in cases where there is no API. If you look carefully at the program in exercise 3, you'll see we used the wget command. In this exercise, we search for a collection in the internet archive, grab all of the file identifiers, and feed these into wget  from the command line or terminal . One command, thousands of documents!  (If you skipped the previous exercise, you need to install wget. Go to  the programming historian tutorial on wget  and follow the relevant instructions (depending on your operating system) to install it.)  This section will follow  Milligan p52-64 . I am not going to spell out the steps this time; I want you to carefully peruse Milligan's presentation, and see if you can follow along (pgs 52-64: he uses wget plus a text file so that wget auto-completes the URLs and scrapes the data found there - much like the final line of the program in exercise 3). There will often be cases where you want to do something, and you find someone's presentations or notes which  almost  tell you everything you need to know. Alternatively, you can complete the tutorial from the  Programming historian  for this exercise. In either case, keep notes on what you've done, what works, where the problems seem to lie, what the tacit knowledge is that isn't made clear (ie, are there assumptions being made in the tutorial or the presentation that are opaque to you?).   hints:   remember that wget is run from your terminal (Mac) or command line (PC). Do you know where to find these?  if you're working on a mac, when you get to the point that Milligan directs you to save the search results file (which came as csv) as a .txt file, you need to select the unicode-16 txt file option.  the wget command is  wget -r -H -nc -np -nH --cut-dirs=2 -A .txt -e robots=off -l1 -i ./itemlist.txt -B 'http://archive.org/download/'  to make sure everything is working, perhaps make a copy of your itemlist.txt file with only ten or so items in it. Call it 'itemlist-short.txt' and put that in the command. That way, if there are errors, you'll find out sooner rather than later!  You might want to make a note in your notebook about what all those 'flags' in the command are doing.  Here's the wget manual  Once it starts working, you might see something like this:   but  if that's all you get, and nothing downloads, the problem is in your txt file.  Make sure  to create your txt file with a text editor (textwrangler, sublime text, notepad) and  not  from  save as...txt  in excel. (If you have an option when you create the text file, make sure the encoding is 'utf-8' rather than 'utf-16').\n- if you're really stuck, see this  blog post from the Internet Archive",

Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases.

If several people all work on the same piece of text, the thinking is that errors will cancel each other out: a proper transcription will emerge from the work of the crowd.

If you've done HIST2809 with me, this will feel rather familiar - but instead of making a transcription that sits in our notebook, we'll make one that lives online. Since it is online, the use of xml tags like \n or \n etc allow us to do some other quite interesting things. We'll look at M. Beal's Colonial Newspaper Database in more detail.

In which case, for this module, I would like you to select two of these exercises which seem most germane for your own research project. You are welcome to work through more of them, of course, but I want the exercises to move your own research forward. Some of these I wrote; some are adapted from \nThe Macroscope\n; others are adapted or used holus-bolus from scholars like \nMiriam Posner\n, \nFred Gibbs\n, and \nHeather Froehlich\n (and I'm grateful that they shared their materials!)\n\n\nnb\n If you start working with the R exercises below, I would suggest you read the introductory bits from Lincoln Mullen's book-in-progress, \nDH Methods in R\n, especially the 'setup' part under 'getting started' (pay attention to the bit on installing packages and dependencies).

The detailed instructions are \nhere\n. I would recommend that you also take a long look at Scott Weingart's series, \nNetworks Demystified\n. Finally, \nheed our warning\n.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\nTopic Modeling Tool\n\n\nIn exercise 2, you will use the 'Topic Modeling Tool' to create a simple topic model and a webpage that allows you to browse the results. \n\n\n\n\nDownload the \ntool\n. (The site for the tool is \nhttps://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/\n. \n\n\nMake sure you have the Colonial Newspaper Database handy on your machine. (You can grab my copy from \nhere\n).\n\n\nDouble-click on the file you downloaded in step 1. This will open a java-based graphical user interface with one of the most common topic-modeling approaches, 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation'.\n\n\nSet the input to be the Colonial Newspaper Database.\n\n\nSet the output to be somewhere neat and tidy on your computer.\n\n\nSet the number of topics you'd like to model.\n\n\nClick 'train topics' to run the algorithm.\n\n\nWhen it finishes, go to the folder you selected for output, and find the file 'all_topics.html' in the 'output_html' folder. Click on that, and you now have a browser-based way of navigating your topics and documents. In the output_csv folder created, you will find the same information as csv, which you could then input into a spreadsheet for other kinds of visualizations (which we'll talk about in class.)\n\n\n\n\nMake a note in your open notebook about your process and your observations.\n\n\nGoing Further\n Remember when we did the Canadiana API and WGET exercises in Module 2? Somewhere on your machine you have a collection of those materials. Now, you can load those materials into the Topic Modeling Tool if you have all of the txt files in a single folder. In the case of the slavery documents, that was something like 7500 items. That's a lot of drag-and-drop. You can 'flatten' the folder structure so that all of the documents in your subfolders are put into a single folder. If you are on a Mac, \ntry these instructions\n. On a PC, \ntry this one\n (there are scripts you can use, but for the time being this is probably simplest).  Then, you can point your topic modeling tool at your flattened folder, and \nboom\n you have a topic model fitted to your collection.\n\n\n\n\nexercise 3\n\n\nTopic Modeling in R\n\n\nExercise 2 was quite a simple way to do topic modeling. There are more powerful ways, and one of these uses a program called R Studio, which is an interface for the R statistical programming language. R is a powerful language for exploring, visualizing, and manipulating all kinds of data, including textual. It is however not the most intutive of environments to work in. In which case, \nRStudio\n is what we need. Download the free version and install it on your machine. *Note also that you need to have R \ndownloaded \n installed first\n! Then, go to \nhttp://tryr.codeschool.com/\n and work your way through some of that tutorial. This tutorial mimics working right in the R console. Remember working in git bash or the terminal in Module 3? It's somewhat similar to that, but just for R. A handy pdf that explains a bit more about working within the R Studio enivornment can be had \nhere\n. In essence, you put your code in the script window, execute each line of it, and the output appears in the console. Or in the image plots window. \nThis handout will guide you around the interface\n.\n\n\nIn this exercise, we're going to grab the Colonial Newspaper Database from my github page, do some exploratory visualizations, and then create a topic model whose output can then be visualized further in other platforms (including as a network in Gephi). The walkthrough \ncan be found here\n. Each gray block is something to copy-and-paste into your script window in R Studio. Then, put the cursor at the start of the first line, and hit ctrl+enter to get RStudio to execute each line. In the walkthrough, when you get to another gray block, just copy and paste it into your script window after the earlier block. Work your way through the walkthrough. The walkthrough gives you an indication of what the output should look like as you move through it. (The walkthrough was written inside R, and then turned into HTML using an R package called 'Knittr'. You can see that this has implications for open research! For reference, \nhere's the original Rmd (R markdown) file that generated the walkthrough\n.)\n\n\nBy the way: when you run this line: \ntopic.model$train(1000)\n your console will fill up with data as it iterates 1000 times over the entire corpus, fitting a topic model to it. This is as it should be!\n\n\nIn this way, you'll build up an entire script for topic modeling materials you find on the web. You can then save your script and upload it to your open notebook. In the future, you'd be able to make just a few changes here and there in order to grab and explore different data.\n\n\nMake a note in your open notebook about your process and your observations.\n\n\nGoing further\n If you wanted to use that script on the materials you collected in module 2, you would have to tell R to load up those materials from a directory, rather than by reading a csv file. Take a look at \nmy script for topic modeling the Ferguson Grand Jury documents\n, especially this line:\n\n\ndocuments \n- mallet.read.dir(\"originaldocs/1000chunks/\")\n\n\nYou feed it the path to your documents. If you are on a windows machine, the path would look a bit different, for instance: \n\n\"C:\\\\research\\\\originaldocs\\\\1000chunks\\\\\"\n\n\n\n\nexercise 4\n\n\nText Analysis with Overview\n\n\nIn exercise 4, we're going to look at the Colonial Newspaper Database again, but this time using a tool called 'Overview'. Overview uses a different approach that the topic models we've been discussing. In essence, it looks at word frequencies and their distributions within a document, and within a corpus, to organize the documents into folders of progressively similar word use. \n\n\nYou can download Overview to run on your own machine, but for our purposes, the hosted version at \nhttps://www.overviewproject.org/\n is sufficient. Go to that page, watch the video, create an account, and then log in.\n\n\nOnce you're inside, click 'import from a CSV file', and upload the CND.csv (which you can download and save to your own machine from \nhere\n \n- right-click and save as. On the 'UPLOAD A CSV FILE' page click 'browse' and select the CND.csv. It will give you a preview. There are a number of options here - you can tell Overview which words to ignore, and which words to give added importance to. What words will you select? Make a note in your notebook. Then hit 'upload'.\n\n\nA new page appears, called 'YOUR DOCUMENT SETS'. Click on the one you just uploaded. A file folder tree showing documents of progressively greater similarity will open; on the right hand side will be the list of documents within each box (the box in question will be greyed out when you click on it, so you know where you are). You can search for words in your document, and Overview will tell you where they are; you can tag documents that you find interesting. The Overview system allows you to jump between a distant, macroscopic view and a close, document level view. Jump back and forth, see what you can find. For suggestions about how to use Overview effectively, try \ntheir blog\n. Make notes about what you observe in your notebook. Also, you can export your tagged document set from Overview, so that you could visualize the patterns of tagging in a spreadsheet (for instance). \n\n\nGoing further\n Do you see how you could upload your documents that you collected during Module 2?\n\n\n\n\nexercise 5\n\n\nCorpus Linguistics with AntConc\n\n\nHeather Froelich has put together an excellent step-by-step with using AntConc for exploring textual patterns within, and across, corpora of texts. Work your way through her tutorial: http://hfroehli.ch/workshops/getting-started-with-antconc/\n\n\nCan you get our example materials (from the CND ) into AntConc? \nThis might help you\n to split the csv into individual txt iles. Alternatively, do you have any materials of your own, already collected? Feed them into AntConc. What patterns do you see? What if you compare your materials against other corpora of texts?\n\n\nFYI, \nhere is a collection of corpora that you can explore\n\n\n\n\nexercise 6\n\n\nText Analysis with Voyant\n\n\nIn module 3 if you recall, we worked through how to transform XML using stylesheets. Melodee Beals used a \nstylesheet \n to transform her database into a series of individual txt files. In the exercises above, a transformer was used to make the database into a single CSV file. In this exercise, we are going to use \nVoyant Tools\n to visualize patterns in word use in the database. Voyant can read either a CSV \nor\n text files. The advantage of uploading a folder of text files is that, if the files are in chronological order, Voyant's default visualizations will also be arranged in chronological order and thus we can see change over time.\n\n\nGo to \nhttp://voyant-tools.org\n. Paste the URL to the csv of the CND database:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/exercise/gh-pages/CND.csv . \n\n\nNow, open a new browser window, and go here http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=colonial-newspapers\nstopList=stop.en.taporware.txt\n\n\nDo you see the difference? In the latter window, the individual articles have been uploaded individually, and thus are treated as individual documents in chronological order.\n\n\nExplore the corpus, comparing terms over time, looking at keywords in context, and using RezoViz to create a graph where people, places, and organizations that appear in the same documents (and across documents) are connected. You can embed any of the tools in your blogs by using the 'save' icon. (You can find 'rezoviz' under the cogwheel icon at the top right of the panel). You can apply 'stopwords' by clicking on the cogwheel in any of the different tools, and selecting stopwords. Apply the stopwords globally, and you'll only have to do this once! What patterns do you see? What do different tools highlight? Which ones are useful? What patterns do you see that strike you as interesting? Note this all down. \n\n\nGoing further\n Upload materials you collected in module 2 and explore them.\n\n\n\n\nexercise 7\n\n\nQuick Charts Using RAW\n\n\nA quick chart can be a handy thing to have. Google spreadsheets, Microsoft Excel, and a host of other programs can make excellent charts quickly with their wizard functions. Never hesitate to turn to these. However, they are not always good with non-numeric data. In module 3, you used the NER to extract place names from a text. After some further munging with regex, you might have ended up with a CSV that looks like \nthis\n. Can we do a quick visualization of this information? One useful tool is \nRAW\n. Open that in a new window. Copy the table of data of places mentioned in the Texan correspondence, and paste it into the data input box at the top of the RAW screen. \n\n\nRAW takes your data, and depending on your choices, passes it into chart templates built on the d3.js code library. D3.js is a powerful library for making all sorts of charts (including interactive ones). If this sort of thing interests you, you can follow the tutorials in \nElijah Meeks' excellent new book\n.\n\n\nWith your data pasted in, you can now experiment with a number of different visualizations that are all built on the d3.js code library.  Try the \u2018alluvial\u2019 diagram.  Pick place1 and place2 as your dimensions. Does anything jump out? Try place3 and place 4. Try place1, place2, place3, and place4 in a single alluvial diagram. When we look at the original letters, we see that the writer often identified the town in which he was writing, and the town of the addressee. Why choose the third and fourth places? Perhaps it makes sense, for a given research question, to assume that with the pleasantries out of the way the writers will discuss the places important to their message. Experiment! This is one of the joys of working with data, experimenting to see how you can deform your materials to see them in a new light.\n\n\n\n\nexercise 8\n\n\nSimple Mapping and Georectifying\n\n\nIn this exercise, you will find a historical map online, upload a copy to a mapwarper service, georectify it, and then display the map online, via a hosted service like CartoDB, and also through a map you will build yourself using leaflet.js. Finally, we will also convert csv to geojson using http://togeojson.com/, and we'll map that as a github gist. We'll also grab a geojson file hosted on github gist and import it into cartodb.\n\n\nGeorectifying\n\n\nGeorectifying is the process of taking an image (whether it is of a historical map, chart, airphoto, or whatever) and manipulating its geometry so that it matches a geographic projection. Think of it like this: you take your handdrawn map, and use pushpins to pin down known locations on your map to a globe. As you pin, your image stretches and warps. Traditionally, this has not been an easy thing to do, if you are new to GIS. In recent years, the curve has flattened significantly. In this exercise, we'll grab an image, upload it to the Harvard Library MapWarper service, and then export it as a tileset which can be used in other mapping programs.\n\n\n\n\nGet a historical map. I like the Fire Insurance plans from the \nGatineau Valley Historical Society\n; I'm sure you can find others to suit your interests.\n\n\nRight-click, save as.... grab a copy. Save it somewhere handy.\n\n\nGo to \nHarvard World MapWarp\n and sign up for an account. Then login.\n\n\nGo to the upload screen: \n \n\n\nFill in as much of the metadata as you can. Then select your map from your computer, and upload it.\n\n\nOn the next page, click 'rectify'. \n \n\n\nPan and zoom both maps until you're sure you're looking at the same area in both. Double click in a map, select the pencil icon, and click on a point (location) you are sure you can match in the other window. Then click on the other map window, select the pencil, and then click on the same point. The 'add control point' button below and between both maps will light up. Click on this to confirm that this is a control point you want. Do this at least three times; the more times you can do it, the better the map warp.\n\n\nHaving selected your control points, click on 'warp image'.\n\n\nYou can now click on the 'export' panel, and get the URL for your georectified image in a few different formats. If you clicked on the KML option, a google map window will open \nlike so\n. For many webmapping applications, the Tiles (Google/OSM scheme): Tiles Based URL is what you want. You'll get a URL like this: \nhttp://warp.worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/tile/4152/z/x/y.png\n   Save that info. You'll need it later.\n\n\n\n\nYou have now georectified a map. Let's use that map as a base layer in \nPalladio\n\n\n\n\nWe need some place data for Palladio. Here's what I'm using \n \n Note how I've formatted this data. I'll be copying and pasting it into Palladio. (For more on how to input geographic data into Palladio, see \nthis tutorial\n.\n\n\nGo to \nPalladio\n. Hit 'start' then 'upload spreadsheet or csv'. In the box, paste in your data.\n\n\nClick on 'map'. Under 'places', select 'coordinates'. Then, click 'add new layer'. In the popup, beside 'Choose one of Palladio default layers or create a new one.', select 'custom'. This is where you're going to paste it that tiles based URL from the map warper. Paste it in, but replace the \n/z/x/y\n part with \n{z}/{x}/{y}\n. Click add.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You've georectified a map, and used it as a base layer for a visualization of some point data. Here are some \nnotes on using a georectified map with the CartoDB service\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexercise 9\n\n\nText Analysis in R\n\n\nI would suggest, before you try this, that you look at the walkthrough for exercise 3, and that you become familiar with R. Then, you can try \nthis tutorial\n, starting at page 3. On that page, the author tells you to create a folder called /corpus/text, and to fill it with text files you'd like to analyse. So why not grab some of the materials you collected in module 2? The problem is, where is this folder supposed to go? In R studio, find out where your working director is by typing\n\n\ngetwd()\n\n\nin the console. Then, you can create the /corpus/text folder \n subfolder at that location. Alternatively, you can set the working directory to wherever you like like so:\n\n\nsetwd(\"C://my-working-folder//\")\n on a pc, or \nsetwd(\"~/my-working-folder/\")\n on a mac.\n\n\nThen, to get going, you'd need\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"tm\")\n\n\nlibrary(tm)\n \n\n\nYou can then work through the entire pdf, or jump ahead to page 37 to see what the completed script would look like (here's \nmy version using the CND again\n. Makes notes of what you find. Google any error messages you find to try to figure out a solution.\n\n\nexercise 10\n\n\nQGIS\n\n\nThere are many excellent tutorials around concerning how to get started with GIS. Our own library, in the \nMADGIC centre\n has tremendous resources and I would encourage you to speak with the map librarians before embarking on any \nserious\n mapping projects. In the short term, the historian \nFred Gibbs\n has an excellent series on using the open source GIS platform \nQGIS\n to make and map historical data.\n\n\nFor this exercise, I would recommend you try Gibbs' first tutorial,\n\n\n'Making a map with QGIS'\n\n\n...and then, try georectifying a historical map and adding it to your GIS:\n\n\n'Using historica maps with qgis'",

Download the  tool . (The site for the tool is  https://code.google.com/p/topic-modeling-tool/ .   Make sure you have the Colonial Newspaper Database handy on your machine. (You can grab my copy from  here ).  Double-click on the file you downloaded in step 1. This will open a java-based graphical user interface with one of the most common topic-modeling approaches, 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation'.  Set the input to be the Colonial Newspaper Database.  Set the output to be somewhere neat and tidy on your computer.  Set the number of topics you'd like to model.  Click 'train topics' to run the algorithm.  When it finishes, go to the folder you selected for output, and find the file 'all_topics.html' in the 'output_html' folder. Click on that, and you now have a browser-based way of navigating your topics and documents. In the output_csv folder created, you will find the same information as csv, which you could then input into a spreadsheet for other kinds of visualizations (which we'll talk about in class.)   Make a note in your open notebook about your process and your observations.  Going Further  Remember when we did the Canadiana API and WGET exercises in Module 2? Somewhere on your machine you have a collection of those materials. Now, you can load those materials into the Topic Modeling Tool if you have all of the txt files in a single folder. In the case of the slavery documents, that was something like 7500 items. That's a lot of drag-and-drop. You can 'flatten' the folder structure so that all of the documents in your subfolders are put into a single folder. If you are on a Mac,  try these instructions . On a PC,  try this one  (there are scripts you can use, but for the time being this is probably simplest).  Then, you can point your topic modeling tool at your flattened folder, and  boom  you have a topic model fitted to your collection.",

            "text": "Topic Modeling in R  Exercise 2 was quite a simple way to do topic modeling. There are more powerful ways, and one of these uses a program called R Studio, which is an interface for the R statistical programming language. R is a powerful language for exploring, visualizing, and manipulating all kinds of data, including textual. It is however not the most intutive of environments to work in. In which case,  RStudio  is what we need. Download the free version and install it on your machine. *Note also that you need to have R  downloaded   installed first ! Then, go to  http://tryr.codeschool.com/  and work your way through some of that tutorial. This tutorial mimics working right in the R console. Remember working in git bash or the terminal in Module 3? It's somewhat similar to that, but just for R. A handy pdf that explains a bit more about working within the R Studio enivornment can be had  here . In essence, you put your code in the script window, execute each line of it, and the output appears in the console. Or in the image plots window.  This handout will guide you around the interface .  In this exercise, we're going to grab the Colonial Newspaper Database from my github page, do some exploratory visualizations, and then create a topic model whose output can then be visualized further in other platforms (including as a network in Gephi). The walkthrough  can be found here . Each gray block is something to copy-and-paste into your script window in R Studio. Then, put the cursor at the start of the first line, and hit ctrl+enter to get RStudio to execute each line. In the walkthrough, when you get to another gray block, just copy and paste it into your script window after the earlier block. Work your way through the walkthrough. The walkthrough gives you an indication of what the output should look like as you move through it. (The walkthrough was written inside R, and then turned into HTML using an R package called 'Knittr'. You can see that this has implications for open research! For reference,  here's the original Rmd (R markdown) file that generated the walkthrough .)  By the way: when you run this line:  topic.model$train(1000)  your console will fill up with data as it iterates 1000 times over the entire corpus, fitting a topic model to it. This is as it should be!  In this way, you'll build up an entire script for topic modeling materials you find on the web. You can then save your script and upload it to your open notebook. In the future, you'd be able to make just a few changes here and there in order to grab and explore different data.  Make a note in your open notebook about your process and your observations.  Going further  If you wanted to use that script on the materials you collected in module 2, you would have to tell R to load up those materials from a directory, rather than by reading a csv file. Take a look at  my script for topic modeling the Ferguson Grand Jury documents , especially this line:  documents  - mallet.read.dir(\"originaldocs/1000chunks/\")  You feed it the path to your documents. If you are on a windows machine, the path would look a bit different, for instance:  \"C:\\\\research\\\\originaldocs\\\\1000chunks\\\\\"",

            "text": "Text Analysis with Overview  In exercise 4, we're going to look at the Colonial Newspaper Database again, but this time using a tool called 'Overview'. Overview uses a different approach that the topic models we've been discussing. In essence, it looks at word frequencies and their distributions within a document, and within a corpus, to organize the documents into folders of progressively similar word use.   You can download Overview to run on your own machine, but for our purposes, the hosted version at  https://www.overviewproject.org/  is sufficient. Go to that page, watch the video, create an account, and then log in.  Once you're inside, click 'import from a CSV file', and upload the CND.csv (which you can download and save to your own machine from  here   - right-click and save as. On the 'UPLOAD A CSV FILE' page click 'browse' and select the CND.csv. It will give you a preview. There are a number of options here - you can tell Overview which words to ignore, and which words to give added importance to. What words will you select? Make a note in your notebook. Then hit 'upload'.  A new page appears, called 'YOUR DOCUMENT SETS'. Click on the one you just uploaded. A file folder tree showing documents of progressively greater similarity will open; on the right hand side will be the list of documents within each box (the box in question will be greyed out when you click on it, so you know where you are). You can search for words in your document, and Overview will tell you where they are; you can tag documents that you find interesting. The Overview system allows you to jump between a distant, macroscopic view and a close, document level view. Jump back and forth, see what you can find. For suggestions about how to use Overview effectively, try  their blog . Make notes about what you observe in your notebook. Also, you can export your tagged document set from Overview, so that you could visualize the patterns of tagging in a spreadsheet (for instance).

Melodee Beals used a  stylesheet   to transform her database into a series of individual txt files. In the exercises above, a transformer was used to make the database into a single CSV file. In this exercise, we are going to use  Voyant Tools  to visualize patterns in word use in the database. Voyant can read either a CSV  or  text files. The advantage of uploading a folder of text files is that, if the files are in chronological order, Voyant's default visualizations will also be arranged in chronological order and thus we can see change over time.  Go to  http://voyant-tools.org . Paste the URL to the csv of the CND database:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawngraham/exercise/gh-pages/CND.csv .   Now, open a new browser window, and go here http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=colonial-newspapers stopList=stop.en.taporware.txt  Do you see the difference? In the latter window, the individual articles have been uploaded individually, and thus are treated as individual documents in chronological order.  Explore the corpus, comparing terms over time, looking at keywords in context, and using RezoViz to create a graph where people, places, and organizations that appear in the same documents (and across documents) are connected. You can embed any of the tools in your blogs by using the 'save' icon. (You can find 'rezoviz' under the cogwheel icon at the top right of the panel).

            "text": "Quick Charts Using RAW  A quick chart can be a handy thing to have. Google spreadsheets, Microsoft Excel, and a host of other programs can make excellent charts quickly with their wizard functions. Never hesitate to turn to these. However, they are not always good with non-numeric data. In module 3, you used the NER to extract place names from a text. After some further munging with regex, you might have ended up with a CSV that looks like  this . Can we do a quick visualization of this information? One useful tool is  RAW . Open that in a new window. Copy the table of data of places mentioned in the Texan correspondence, and paste it into the data input box at the top of the RAW screen.   RAW takes your data, and depending on your choices, passes it into chart templates built on the d3.js code library. D3.js is a powerful library for making all sorts of charts (including interactive ones). If this sort of thing interests you, you can follow the tutorials in  Elijah Meeks' excellent new book .  With your data pasted in, you can now experiment with a number of different visualizations that are all built on the d3.js code library.  Try the \u2018alluvial\u2019 diagram.  Pick place1 and place2 as your dimensions. Does anything jump out? Try place3 and place 4. Try place1, place2, place3, and place4 in a single alluvial diagram. When we look at the original letters, we see that the writer often identified the town in which he was writing, and the town of the addressee. Why choose the third and fourth places? Perhaps it makes sense, for a given research question, to assume that with the pleasantries out of the way the writers will discuss the places important to their message. Experiment!

Finally, we will also convert csv to geojson using http://togeojson.com/, and we'll map that as a github gist. We'll also grab a geojson file hosted on github gist and import it into cartodb.  Georectifying  Georectifying is the process of taking an image (whether it is of a historical map, chart, airphoto, or whatever) and manipulating its geometry so that it matches a geographic projection. Think of it like this: you take your handdrawn map, and use pushpins to pin down known locations on your map to a globe. As you pin, your image stretches and warps. Traditionally, this has not been an easy thing to do, if you are new to GIS. In recent years, the curve has flattened significantly. In this exercise, we'll grab an image, upload it to the Harvard Library MapWarper service, and then export it as a tileset which can be used in other mapping programs.   Get a historical map. I like the Fire Insurance plans from the  Gatineau Valley Historical Society ; I'm sure you can find others to suit your interests.  Right-click, save as.... grab a copy. Save it somewhere handy.  Go to  Harvard World MapWarp  and sign up for an account. Then login.  Go to the upload screen:     Fill in as much of the metadata as you can. Then select your map from your computer, and upload it.  On the next page, click 'rectify'.     Pan and zoom both maps until you're sure you're looking at the same area in both. Double click in a map, select the pencil icon, and click on a point (location) you are sure you can match in the other window. Then click on the other map window, select the pencil, and then click on the same point. The 'add control point' button below and between both maps will light up. Click on this to confirm that this is a control point you want. Do this at least three times; the more times you can do it, the better the map warp.  Having selected your control points, click on 'warp image'.  You can now click on the 'export' panel, and get the URL for your georectified image in a few different formats. If you clicked on the KML option, a google map window will open  like so . For many webmapping applications, the Tiles (Google/OSM scheme): Tiles Based URL is what you want. You'll get a URL like this:  http://warp.worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/tile/4152/z/x/y.png    Save that info. You'll need it later.   You have now georectified a map. Let's use that map as a base layer in  Palladio   We need some place data for Palladio. Here's what I'm using     Note how I've formatted this data. I'll be copying and pasting it into Palladio. (For more on how to input geographic data into Palladio, see  this tutorial .  Go to  Palladio . Hit 'start' then 'upload spreadsheet or csv'. In the box, paste in your data.  Click on 'map'. Under 'places', select 'coordinates'. Then, click 'add new layer'. In the popup, beside 'Choose one of Palladio default layers or create a new one.', select 'custom'. This is where you're going to paste it that tiles based URL from the map warper. Paste it in, but replace the  /z/x/y  part with  {z}/{x}/{y} . Click add.   Congratulations!

            "text": "Exercises\n\n\nThe exercises in this module are about colour, layout, and manipulating graphics - but not necessarily in that order. All students must complete the 'Sprucing up a PDF in Inkscape' exercise, as well as the 'Typography', 'Colour', and 'Layout' exercises. Everything after that is optional (including the option to not do them).\n\n\nSprucing up a PDF in Inkscape\n | \nTypography\n | \nColour\n | \nLayout\n | \nMore\n\n\n\n\nUkraine fist fight\n\n\nBy the way: Raster v Vector\n\n\nThe first thing to know is that graphic images come in two distince flavours - raster, and vector.\n\n\nRaster images are composed of pixels, such that if you zoom into them, they become a pointilist blur (if you remember \nFerris Beuller's Day Off\n, there's a scene where Cameron stares and stares at a painting, falling into its individual points of colour...). Vector images on the other hand are described by mathematical functions, of lines and arcs and areas. No matter how deep you delve into these kinds of images, the image is always sharp - because the zoom is just another function of the mathematics describing the image.\n\n\nRasters: blocks of colours\n\n\nVectors: descriptions of points and arcs\n\n\nSprucing up a pdf in Inkscape\n\n\nSome of the tools that we used in Module 4 give visual output as raster images, others as vectors. Sometimes, we would like to tweak these outputs to make them more visually appealling, or clearer, or more useful. A program like MS Paint is only useful for dealing with raster images (and then, only in certain kinds of cases). We need a program that can deal with both, and also, lets us edit the image by treating each edit we do as a mostly-transparent layer on top of the image. That way, we can add, rearrange, hide or reveal, our edits to create a composite image. A free program that is immensely useful in this regard is \nInkscape\n. Inkscape is also quite useful in that we can open a pdf file in it, break the visual elements of the pdf into individual layers, and then rearrange/touch up/fix them up to make them more esthetically appealing.\n\n\nIn this first exercise, we will take the plot we generated in Module 4's exercise on topic modeling in R where we made a bar chart showing the number of articles by year. In R we exported that plot as a PDF. In Inkscape, we can import that pdf and 'explode' it so that we can manipulate its parts individually. We are going to take the simple bar chart and make it more legible, more visually appealing, for incorporation on a webpage.\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install \nInkscape\n \nnb Mac\n the installation instructions are a bit more complicated for Mac. Pay attention and follow closely!\n\n\nDownload the pdf we generated in R \npublication-year.pdf\n \n\n\nOpen that pdf. It's a pretty plain graphic. Right away there are at least two things we could do to make it more visually appealling. We could change the orientation of the characters in the y-axis to make them more legible. We can highlight bars of interest. And we could apply a colour scheme more generally that would make our graphic legible to folks with colour-blindness (see the 'going further' section at bottom).\n\n\nStart Inkscape. Click File \n Import \n and then navigate to where you save the 'publication-year.pdf'. Click Ok when you've got it selected. In the next pop-up, just accept the default settings and click 'ok'. Your Inkscape window should now look like this:\n\n\nThe pdf is now a layer in the new image you are creating in Inkscape. You can save this drawing, \nwith its information about the layers and what is in each one\n by clicking File \n Save As. (\nhere's my version\n). 'SVG' stands for 'scalable vector graphic'.\n\n\nDo you see the bounding box around the plot? If you grab any of those handles (the double-arrow things), you can make it bigger or smaller on your sheet. We can't edit any of the other elements yet - we can't change the colour of the bars, or the fonts of the text. We have to tell Inkscape to 'explode' these elements into their own 'objects'. In the menu bar at top, got to Object \n Ungroup. There are now a series of overlapping bounding boxes around each object.\n\n\nZoom in (by pressing the + sign on your keyboard) so that you're looking at the numbers of the y-axis. We're going to rotate these by 90 degrees to make them more legible. Select the arrow icon from the toolbar on the left side of the screen.\n\n\nClick on the '50'. You'll get a bounding box around it. Click Object \n Rotate 90 CW. The 50 is now rotated! Do the same for the other numbers. Save. (If you double-click on the number, you might trigger the 'text edit' function. If you do that, no problem - you can change the font, change the number... although if you did that, it'd be a bit dishonest, right? Click on the arrow pointer icon in the toolbar again to get out of the text-editing function).\n\n\nLet's imagine, for whatever reason, that you wanted to change one of the bars to a different colour, to highlight its importance to your argument. With the arrow icon, click on one of the bars so that you get the bounding box around it. Then, click on one of the colours from the palette at the bottom. Boom! You've got a newly colourized bar. Save.\n\n\nAdd a legend. Write it so that the important message you want your viewer to get is immediately clear. Choose a font from Inkscape's included fonts that \nsupports\n your message.\n\n\nTo export your image so that you can use it in a website or paper, click Edit \n Select All in All Layers. Every element of your image will now have a bounding box around it.\n\n\nGo to File \n Export Bitmap. Never mind the options in the popup; just hit 'Export'. Inkscape will automatically assign your drawing a name with .png; here's \nmine\n. Remember, if you want to edit this image again later, hit the 'save' button to save it as an svg. The svg will preserve all your layer information, while the png file is the visual representation (the png is in fact a raster graphic). Most browsers can handle svg files, so you could use that in your website; programs like Word seem to be able to handle raster graphics better than they do svg. You might want to experiment. In any event, every journal has different requirements for image formats. You would export your image to whatever those specifications are.\n\n\n\n\nGoing further\n\n\nIn this \ntutorial, you will learn how to load a custom colour palette\n. Why might you want to do that? You should be designing your work so that it is as universally accessible as possible. Many folks are colour-blind. Use \nColor-brewer\n to generate a colour-blind safe palette. Then look for the 'GIMP and Inkscape - GIMP color palette for this scheme.' Click on that link, and you'll get a text file with the scheme you generated. Use that scheme to alter the colours on your plot.\n\n\n\n\nTypography\n\n\nTypographic plays an important role in visual communication. It can do everything from reduce eyestrain (do a search for 'easiest fonts to read on screen') to communicate power and authority. Is it any wonder that strong bold capitals come to be known as 'Roman'? But first: \nare you a comic sans criminal?\n\n\nIn this exercise, \n+ I want you to read and understand the section on \nfont choices from the Owl at Purdue\n. \n+ Then, play some rounds of \nTypeconnection\n. Pay attention to why - or why not - various pairings work. \n+ Then, I want to consider the document you will be preparing for me that accounts for your learning in this course - the document where you choose your best exercises from the modules and explain how your approach to history, data, the digital, etc, has changed over this course. What typographic pair would work best for you? \n+ Finally, you'll make a webpage that uses those fonts and explains why they work.\n\n\nThe first part of this exercise then is to find a pair and to understand why they work best for you - go read the materials above, and once you're done with the Typeconnection site, go to \nGoogle Fonts\n and search for a pair that are \nsuitable for your purpose\n. When you find a font you like, click the 'add to collection' button. Then, at the bottom of the screen, you'll see a link for 'use'. Click on this - google will ask you if you want to use any of the variants of the font. Tick off accordingly. Then, do you see the embed code that google provides, and the code to integrate the font into your CSS (stylesheet)? Leave this window open - we're going to use it in a moment.\n\n\n\n\nIn your repository, click the button beside 'branch'. In the search box that opens, type in \ngh-pages\n. This will create a version of your repository that can be served as a website.\n\n\nYou're now in the gh-pages branch. Click on the + sign beside the repository name. This will create a new file in your gh-branch of your repository. Call it \nmyfontchoice.html\n \n- the .html is important to specify; otherwise your browser will not know how to render your page.\n\n\nYou now need to put some html in there. I've written a simple webpage that will use two fonts from Google Fonts, and then applies the font to my text depending on whether or not it is a header, which you specify like this: \nh1\n this is a header in between header tags \n/h1\n or a paragraph, which you specify like this: \np\nblah blah blah a paragraph of text blah blah blah\n/p\n. My webpage is \nhere\n; right-click the link and open in a new tab. Copy the html into your new html document. Commit your changes (ie, save!).\n\n\nLet's see what we've got. To see the website version of your gh-pages branch, you go to \nyourusername\n.github.io/\nreponame\n/myfontchoice.html\n \n- ie, the final part of the url is the name of the document in your repo. Do that now. You should see a simple webpage, with two very distinctive fonts.\n\n\nNow: let's slide your font choices into the html. Go to your html page in your gh-pages repo (ie, not the \ngithub.io\n version, but the \ngithub.com/\nyourusername\n/\nrepo\n/myfontchoice.html\n version. Hit the edit button. Look closely at line 6. Do you see my two fonts? Do you see the pipe character between them? That tells google you want \nboth\n fonts. Go look at the google fonts page again to grab the exact name for your fonts (ie, uppercase letters make a difference!) and paste them into line 5 appropriately.\n\n\nLines 8 and 14 specify which font to use for headers, and which font to use for body text. Change appropriately. \n\n\nChange my silly text for a paragraph that explains what the fonts are, and why they work for this purpose. Commit your changes.\n\n\nGo to the \ngithub.io\n version of your repository (if you forget the address, you can find it under the 'settings' button on your normal repository page when you're in the gh-pages branch). Reload the page a couple of times to clear the older version you've already looked at and to replace it with your version. Ta da! Not only have you thought carefully about typography and fonts, you've also learned how to serve a webpage from a Github repository.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n You could use this as the basics of your submission for assessment, for your exercises. Build a webpage, link to your evidence, embed your images... For basic html \nhere's a really good guide to keep around\n. \n\n\n\n\nColour\n\n\nThere's a lot of bumpf out there on the 'pyschology of colour'. Google it to see what I mean (\nhere's an example\n). A lot of what you see here isn't so much psychology as it is associations (and indeed, western associations, at that). Associations are important of course; you don't want to undermine your message by making some unfortunate connections. \n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, I want you to take the webpage you developed in the previous exercise, and make two versions of it: one, where the colours support the broader message of the page (a prototype for your exercises assessment piece, remember?), and the other where the colours \nundermine\n that broader message. Explain, in both cases, how your colour choices enhance/detract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalternatively, you can make a one page slide in powerpoint doing the same thing.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nHere's a graphic \n a movie to help with the theoretical side of things:\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the rules of color, Lynda.com\n\n\nTo learn how to style your webpage appropriately, you can \nfollow this tutorial on CSS from codeacademy.com\n.\n\n\nEffective colour contrast\n\n\nColours in Cultures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayout\n\n\n'Layout' can mean different things in different contexts. A general overview on issues in layout is covered by \n'What makes design great, Lynda.com\n and \n'Exploring principles of layout and composition'\n. This \nslideshare\n gives you a sense of things to watch out for as well.\n\n\nFor academic posters in particular, consider \nthese suggestions from the APA\n.\n\n\nIn essence, good layout makes your argument legible, intuitive, and reinforces the rhetorical points you are trying to make. You should take into account 'principles of universal design' - consider these issues with \npowerpoint\n and with \nwebsites\n (although some of the technical solutions proposed in those two documents are a bit out of date, the general principles hold!) \n\n\nIn this exercise, you will design a new poster OR modify an existing poster. You can use either Inkscape or Powerpoint. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInkscape: download one of the scientific poster templates from \nUgo Sangiorgi\n (These are developed from \nthis blog post\n; note his discussion on design). Open it in Inkscape. Make notes in your open notebook: \nfrom the point of view of layout\n, what elements of the design work? What aren't working? How would you repurpose this poster to fit the requirements of the assessment exercise (\nremember, details here\n)?  \n Here's \nhelp with the basics of Inkscape\n. Modify the poster, and upload the svg or pdf or png version to your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPPT: there's a lot of information out there on making posters with powerpoint. \nRead parts 1,2, and 3 here\n and then consider \nthe advice here\n. Once you've read and digested, pick a poster from \nPimp my poster\n that strikes use. Make notes in your open notebook: \nfrom the point of view of layout\n what elements of the design work? What aren't working? How would you repurpose this posert to fit the requirements ot he assessment exercies (\nremember, details here\n)? \n Grab a template from \nhere\n, and use it to prototype a poster that works. Upload the poster as a pdf to your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to explore layout in the context of webpage creation, I would point you to the the roster of lessons at \nCodeacademy\n. Same instructions: find an existing site that you will consider from the point of view of what works, what doesn't, and use that reflection to guide the construction of your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nMore resources, tutorials, and things to explore.\n\n\nAccessibility and Design\n\n\nWhile most of this applies to websites, think also about how the general principles apply to other ways \n means of telling our data stories.\n+ \nHow People with Disabilities Use the Web\n\n+ \nWeb Content Accessibility and Mobile Web\n\n+ \nAccessibility in HTML5\n\n+ \nWeb Accessibility Evaluation Tool\n\n+ \nConsidering the User Perspective\n\n+ \nConstructing a POUR Website\n Percievable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.

In essence, you upload a network file in .gexf format (which you can export from Gephi) and it renders it on the screen. There are some layout options to make the graph more intelligible. Then, you take a series of snapshots zoomed in on the graph in different places, and add text to describe what it is that's important about these networks. The app puts a Prezi-like wrapper around your snapshots, and the whole can then be embedded in a website or be used as a standalone website. \nHere's my first attempt.\n \n\n\nYou can also embed nearly anything in the narrative panels - youtube videos, \ntimeline.js\n, as long as you know how to correctly format an \niframe\n.  \n\n\nTo give this a try, why not use the Texan Correspondence network we generated in earlier modules? Export it in .gexf format from gephi, import to ManyLines, and go! The interface is fairly straightforward. Just follow the prompts. \n\n\nCaveat Utilitor\n I don't know how long anything made with ManyLines will live on their website. But, knowing what you know about wget and other tools, do you see how you could archive a copy on your own machine? ManyLines is available on \ngithub\n so you can certainly use it locally.\n\n\nLeaflet\n\n\nMaps can be created through a variety of services (\ntilemill\n, \ncartodb\n, \nmapbox\n, for instance). These can then be embedded in your webpages or documents. Often, that's enough. But sometimes, you'd like to take control, and keep all the data, all the map, under your own name, in your own webspace. Here is a gentle introduction to using \nleaflet.js\n to make, style, and serve your maps. \nHere is a template\n for mapping with leaflet, drawing all of your point data and ancillary information from a csv file.\n\n\nOh, and here's a list of background maps you can use: \nhttp://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html\n.\n\n\nDesigning Maps with Processing and Illustrator\n\n\nNicolas Felton is a renowned designer; this 90 minute workshop is worth watching and working through. \nSkillshare\n\n\nCaveat: I do not use processing or illustrator, but processing is free and Inkscape can do many of the things that Illustrator does.\n\n\nDiagramming with yWorks\n\n\nhttp://www.yworks.com/en/",

Raster images are composed of pixels, such that if you zoom into them, they become a pointilist blur (if you remember  Ferris Beuller's Day Off , there's a scene where Cameron stares and stares at a painting, falling into its individual points of colour...). Vector images on the other hand are described by mathematical functions, of lines and arcs and areas. No matter how deep you delve into these kinds of images, the image is always sharp - because the zoom is just another function of the mathematics describing the image.

            "text": "Some of the tools that we used in Module 4 give visual output as raster images, others as vectors. Sometimes, we would like to tweak these outputs to make them more visually appealling, or clearer, or more useful. A program like MS Paint is only useful for dealing with raster images (and then, only in certain kinds of cases). We need a program that can deal with both, and also, lets us edit the image by treating each edit we do as a mostly-transparent layer on top of the image. That way, we can add, rearrange, hide or reveal, our edits to create a composite image. A free program that is immensely useful in this regard is  Inkscape . Inkscape is also quite useful in that we can open a pdf file in it, break the visual elements of the pdf into individual layers, and then rearrange/touch up/fix them up to make them more esthetically appealing.  In this first exercise, we will take the plot we generated in Module 4's exercise on topic modeling in R where we made a bar chart showing the number of articles by year. In R we exported that plot as a PDF. In Inkscape, we can import that pdf and 'explode' it so that we can manipulate its parts individually. We are going to take the simple bar chart and make it more legible, more visually appealing, for incorporation on a webpage.   Download and install  Inkscape   nb Mac  the installation instructions are a bit more complicated for Mac. Pay attention and follow closely!  Download the pdf we generated in R  publication-year.pdf    Open that pdf. It's a pretty plain graphic. Right away there are at least two things we could do to make it more visually appealling. We could change the orientation of the characters in the y-axis to make them more legible. We can highlight bars of interest. And we could apply a colour scheme more generally that would make our graphic legible to folks with colour-blindness (see the 'going further' section at bottom).  Start Inkscape. Click File   Import   and then navigate to where you save the 'publication-year.pdf'. Click Ok when you've got it selected. In the next pop-up, just accept the default settings and click 'ok'. Your Inkscape window should now look like this:  The pdf is now a layer in the new image you are creating in Inkscape. You can save this drawing,  with its information about the layers and what is in each one  by clicking File   Save As. ( here's my version ). 'SVG' stands for 'scalable vector graphic'.  Do you see the bounding box around the plot? If you grab any of those handles (the double-arrow things), you can make it bigger or smaller on your sheet. We can't edit any of the other elements yet - we can't change the colour of the bars, or the fonts of the text. We have to tell Inkscape to 'explode' these elements into their own 'objects'. In the menu bar at top, got to Object   Ungroup. There are now a series of overlapping bounding boxes around each object.  Zoom in (by pressing the + sign on your keyboard) so that you're looking at the numbers of the y-axis. We're going to rotate these by 90 degrees to make them more legible. Select the arrow icon from the toolbar on the left side of the screen.  Click on the '50'. You'll get a bounding box around it. Click Object   Rotate 90 CW. The 50 is now rotated! Do the same for the other numbers. Save. (If you double-click on the number, you might trigger the 'text edit' function. If you do that, no problem - you can change the font, change the number... although if you did that, it'd be a bit dishonest, right? Click on the arrow pointer icon in the toolbar again to get out of the text-editing function).  Let's imagine, for whatever reason, that you wanted to change one of the bars to a different colour, to highlight its importance to your argument. With the arrow icon, click on one of the bars so that you get the bounding box around it. Then, click on one of the colours from the palette at the bottom. Boom! You've got a newly colourized bar. Save.  Add a legend. Write it so that the important message you want your viewer to get is immediately clear. Choose a font from Inkscape's included fonts that  supports  your message.  To export your image so that you can use it in a website or paper, click Edit   Select All in All Layers. Every element of your image will now have a bounding box around it.  Go to File   Export Bitmap. Never mind the options in the popup; just hit 'Export'. Inkscape will automatically assign your drawing a name with .png; here's  mine .

            "text": "Manylines  is an application that allows you to create narratives from network graphs. In essence, you upload a network file in .gexf format (which you can export from Gephi) and it renders it on the screen. There are some layout options to make the graph more intelligible. Then, you take a series of snapshots zoomed in on the graph in different places, and add text to describe what it is that's important about these networks. The app puts a Prezi-like wrapper around your snapshots, and the whole can then be embedded in a website or be used as a standalone website.  Here's my first attempt.    You can also embed nearly anything in the narrative panels - youtube videos,  timeline.js , as long as you know how to correctly format an  iframe .    To give this a try, why not use the Texan Correspondence network we generated in earlier modules? Export it in .gexf format from gephi, import to ManyLines, and go! The interface is fairly straightforward. Just follow the prompts.   Caveat Utilitor  I don't know how long anything made with ManyLines will live on their website.

When you approach a primary source like this, it is tempting to read through it from beginning to end, to get an overview of its contents, and then 'mine' or 'cherry-pick' good quotations to include in your assessments.  However, we are going to focus on examine a very small part of the text in a very high level of detail.  \n\n\nSetting Up Your Workspace\n\n\nArrange your workspace so that you have the scanned text of the pamphlet easily visible on one side of your screen.

            "text": "Using the Stanford NER to tag a corpus\n\n\nIn our regular expressions example, we were able to extract some of the metadata from the document because it was more or less already formatted in such a way that we could write a pattern to find it. Sometimes however clear-cut patterns are not quite as easy to apply. For instance, what if we were interested in the place names that appear in the documents? What if we suspected that the focus of diplomatic activity shifted over time? This is where \u2018named entity recognition\u2019 can be useful. Named entity recognition covers a broad range of techniques, based on machine learning and statistical models of language to laboriously trained classifiers using dictionaries. One of the easiest to use out-of-the-box is the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer.  In essence, we tell it \u2018here is a block of text \u2013 classify!\u2019 It will then process through the text, looking at the structure of your text and matching it against its statistical models of word use to identify person, organization, and locations. One can also expand that classification to extract time, money, percent, and date. \n\n\nGrab the Stanford NER\n\n\nLet us use the NER to extract person, organization, and locations.  First, download the Stanford NER from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml and extract it to your machine. Open the location where you extracted the files. \n+ On a Mac, double-click on the one called \u2018ner-gui.command\u2019. (Mac Users: there is also this excellent tutorial from Michelle Moravec \nyou may wish to consult\n.\n+ On PC, double-click on ner-gui.bat. This opens up a new window (using Java) with \u2018Stanford Named Entity Recognizer\u2019 and also a terminal window. \n\n\nDon\u2019t touch the terminal window for now. (\nPC users, hang on a moment\n \u2013 there is a bit more that you need to know before you can use this tool successfully. You will have to use the command line in order to get the output out).\n\n\nRunning the NER via its GUI\n\n\nIn the \u2018Stanford Named Entity Recognizer\u2019 window there is some default text. Click inside this window and delete the text. Then, click on \u2018File,\u2019 then \u2018Open,\u2019 and select your text for the diplomatic correspondence of the Republic of Texas (that you should still have from earlier modules in this course). Since this text file contains a lot of extraneous information in it \u2013 information which we are not currently interested in, including the publishing information and the index table of letters \u2013 you should open the file in a text editor first and delete that information. We want just the letters for this exercise. Save with a new name and then open it using \u2018File \n open\u2019 in the Stanford NER. The file will open within the window. In the Stanford NER window, click on \u2018classifier\u2019 then \u2018load CRF from file\u2019. Navigate to where you unzipped the Stanford NER folder. Click on the \u2018classifier\u2019 folder. There are a number of files here; the ones that you are interested in end with .gz:\n\n\nenglish.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser.gz\n\n\nenglish.all.4class.distsim.crf.ser.gz\n\n\neglish.muc.7class.distsim.crf.ser.gz\n\n\nThese files correspond to these entities to extract:\n\n\n3class:    Location, Person, Organization\n\n\n4class:    Location, Person, Organization, Misc\n\n\n7class:    Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent, Date\n\n\nSelect the location, person, and organization classifier (ie, 3class) and then press \u2018Run NER.\u2019 At this point, the program will appear to \u2018hang\u2019 \u2013 nothing much will seem to be happening. However, in the background, the program has started to process your text. Depending on the size of your text, this could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Be patient! Watch the terminal window \u2013 once the program has results for you, these will start to scroll by in the terminal window. In the main program window, once the entire text has processed, the text will appear with colour-coded highlighting showing which words are location words, which ones are persons, which ones are organizations. You have now classified a text. Note: sometimes your computer may run out of memory \u2013 in that case, you\u2019ll see an error referring to \u201cOut of Heap Space\u201d in your terminal window. That\u2019s OK \u2013 just copy and paste a smaller bit of the document, say the first 10,000 lines or so. Then try again.\n\n\nManipulating that data\n\n\nMac users can grab the data and paste it elsewhere; PC users will have to run the NER from the command line to get usable output.\n\n\nMac Users\n\n\nOn a Mac, you can copy and paste the output from the terminal window into your text editor of choice. It will look something like: \n\n\nLOCATION: Texas\n\nPERSON: Moore\n\nORGANIZATION: Suprema\n\n\nAnd so forth. Once you've pasted it into Textwrangler (or whatever text editor you use), you can now use regular expressions to manipulate the text further. More in a moment.\n\n\nPC Users\n\n\nOn a PC, things are not so simple because the command window only shows a small fraction of the complete output \u2013 you cannot copy and paste it all! What we have to do instead is type in a command at the command prompt, rather than using the graphical interface, and then redirect the output into a new text file. \n\n\n\n\nOpen a command prompt in the Stanford NER folder on your Windows machine (you can right-click on the folder in your windows explorer, and select \u2018open command prompt here\u2019).\n\n\nType the following as a single line:\n\n\n\n\njava -mx500m -cp stanford-ner.jar edu.stanford.nlp.ie.crf.CRFClassifier -loadClassifier classifiers/english.all.3class.distsim.crf.ser.gz -textFile texas-letters.txt -outputFormat inlineXML \n \u201cmy-ner-output.txt\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe first bit, \njava \u2013mx500m\n says how much memory to use. If you have 1gb of memory available, you can type \njava \u2013mx 1g\n (or 2g, or 3g, etc). The next part of the command calls the NER programme itself.  You can set which classifier to use after the \n\u2013loadClassifier classifiers/\n by typing in the exact file name for the classifier you wish to use (you are telling \u2018loadClassifier\u2019 the exact path to the classifier). At \n\u2013textFile\n you give it the name of your input file (on our machine, called \ntexas-letters.txt\n, and then specify the outputFormat.  The \n character sends the output to a new text file, here called \nmy-ner-output.txt\n.

Since 2012, it has been open-sourced and freely available on the net. Using it takes a bit of getting used to, however. Visit the \nOpen Refine\n home page and watch the three videos. Then, \ndownload it to your machine\n\n\nFollow the installation instructions. Start Open Refine by double clicking on its icon. This will open a new browser window, pointing to http://127.0.0.1:3333. This location is your own computer, so even though it looks like it\u2019s running on the internet, it isn\u2019t.

Click on \u2018choose files\u2019 and select the CSV file created in exercise 2. This will give you a preview of your data. Name your project in the box on the top right side (eg., 'm3-exercise3' or similar) and then click \u2018create project\u2019. It may take a few minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your project has started, one of the columns that should be visible in your data is \u2018sender\u2019. Click on the arrow to the left of \"Sender\" in OpenRefine and select Facet-\nText Facet. Do the same with the arrow next to \"Recipient\". A box will appear on the left side of the browser showing all 189 names listed as senders in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet itself is nearly a thousand rows, so immediately we see that, in this correspondence collection, some names are used multiple times. You may also have noticed that many of the names suffered from errors in the text scan (OCR or Optical Character Recognition errors), rendering some identical names from the book as similar, but not the same, in the spreadsheet. For example the recipient \"Juan de Dios Cafiedo\" is occasionally listed as \"Juan de Dios CaAedo\". Any subsequent analysis will need these errors to be cleared up, and OpenRefine will help fix them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the \"Sender\" facet box on the left-hand side, click on the button labeled \"Cluster\". This feature presents various automatic ways of merging values that appear to be the same.   Play with the values in the drop-down boxes and notice how the number of clusters found change depending on which method is used. Because the methods are slightly different, each will present different matches that may or may not be useful. If you see two values which should be merged, e.g. \"Ashbel Smith\" and \". Ashbel Smith\", check the box to the right in the 'Merge' column and click the 'Merge Selected \n Re-Cluster' button below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo through the various cluster methods one-at-a-time, including changing number values, and merge the values which appear to be the same. \"Juan de Dios CaAedo\" clearly should be merged with \"Juan de Dios Cafiedo\", however \"Correspondent in Tampico\" probably should not be merged with \"Correspondent at Vera Cruz.\" Since we are not experts, we will have to use our best judgement in these cases - or get cracking on some more research to help us make the call. By the end, you should have reduced the number of unique Senders from 189 to around 150. Repeat these steps with Recipients, reducing unique Recipients from 192 to about 160. To finish the automatic cleaning of the data, click the arrow next to \"Sender\" and select 'Edit Cells-\nCommon transforms-\nTrim leading and trailing whitespace'. Repeat for \"Recipient\". The resulting spreadsheet will not be perfect, but it will be much easier to clean by hand than it would have been before taking this step. Click on \u2018export\u2019 at the top right of the window to get your data back out as a .csv file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what?\n\n\nThe text you've just cleaned could now be loaded into something like \nPalladio\n or \nGephi\n for network analysis! However, every network analysis program has its own idiosyncracies. Gephi, for instance, can import lists of relationships if the CSV file has columns labelled 'source' and 'target'. So let's assume that's where we want to visualize \n analyze this data:\n\n\n\n\nIn order to get this correspondence data into Gephi, we will have to rename the \"Sender\" column to \"source\" and the \"Recipient\" column to \"target\". You could do this in a spreadsheet, of course. But since you have Open Refine running.... In the arrow to the left of Sender in the main OpenRefine window, select Edit column-\nRename this column, and rename the column \"source\". Now in the top right of the window, select 'Export-\nCustom tabular exporter'. Notice that \"source\", \"target\", and \"Date\" are checked in the content tab; uncheck \"Date\", as it will not be used in Gephi (networks where the nodes have different dates, ie dynamic networks, are fiddly and we will go into them in more detail later). Go to the download tab and change the download option from 'Tab-separated values (TSV)' to 'Comma-separated values (CSV)' and press download.  The file will likely download to your automatic download directory. We will revisit this file later. You can drop it into the Palladio interface right now though! Go ahead and do that.

            "text": "A gentle introduction to Regular Expressions\n\n\nthis text is adopted from the first drafts of\n The Macroscope \nwhich is currently in-press with Imperial College Press. Users should consult that version once it's published.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nA regular expression (also called regex) is a powerful tool for finding and manipulating text.  At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. A regular expression can help you find every line that begins with a number, or every instance of an email address, or whenever a word is used even if there are slight variations in how it's spelled. As long as you can describe the pattern you're looking for, regular expressions can help you find it. Once you've found your patterns, they can then help you manipulate your text so that it fits just what you need. \n\n\nRegular expressions can look pretty complex, but once you know the basic syntax and vocabulary, simple \u2018regexes\u2019 will be easy. Regular expressions can often be used right inside the 'Find and Replace' box in many text and document editors, such as Notepad++ on Windows, or TextWrangler on OS X. Do not use Microsoft Word, however! To find these text editors, you can find \nNotepad++ here\n or \nTextWrangler here\n.\n\n\n\n\nNB in Notepad++ when you do a search, to use regular expressions in your search you must tick off the checkbox enabling them. Otherwise, Notepad++ will treat your search literally, looking for that exact \ntext\n rather than the \npattern\n. Similarly in Textwrangler, you need to tick off the box marked 'grep' when you bring up the search dialogue panel.\n\n\n\n\nSome basic principles\n\n\n\n\nprotip: there are libraries of regular expressions, online. For example, if you want to find all postal codes, you can search \u201cregular expression Canadian postal code\u201d and learn what \u2018formula\u2019 to search for to find them\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you're looking for all the instances of \"cat\" or \"dog\" in your document. When you type the vertical bar on your keyboard (it looks like \n|\n, shift+backslash on windows keyboards), that means 'or' in regular expressions. So, if your query is dog|cat and you press 'find', it will show you the first time either dog or cat appears in your text.\n\n\nIf you want to replace every instance of either \"cat\" or \"dog\" in your document with the world \"animal\", you would open your find-and-replace box, put \ndog|cat\n in the search query, put animal in the 'replace' box, hit 'replace all', and watch your entire document fill up with references to animals instead of dogs and cats.\n\n\nThe astute reader will have noticed a problem with the instructions above; simply replacing every instance of \"dog\" or \"cat\" with \"animal\" is bound to create problems. Simple searches don't differentiate between letters and spaces, so every time \"cat\" or \"dog\" appear within words, they'll also be replaced with \"animal\". \"catch\" will become \"animalch\"; \"dogma\" will become \"animalma\"; \"certificate\" will become \"certifianimale\". In this case, the solution appears simple; put a space before and after your search query, so now it reads: \n\n\ndog | cat\n  \n\n\nWith the spaces, \"animal\" replace \"dog\" or \"cat\" only in those instances where they're definitely complete words; that is, when they're separated by spaces.\n\n\nThe even more astute reader will notice that this still does not solve our problem of replacing every instance of \"dog\" or \"cat\". What if the word comes at the beginning of a line, so it is not in front of a space? What if the word is at the end of a sentence or a clause, and thus followed by a punctuation? Luckily, in the language of regex, you can represent the beginning or end of a word using special characters. \n\n\n\\\n \n\n\nmeans the beginning of a word. In some programs, like TextWrangler, this is used instead:\n\n\n\\b\n\n\nso if you search for \n\\\ncat\n , (or, in TextWrangler, \n\\bcat\n )it will find \"cat\", \"catch\", and \"catsup\", but not \"copycat\", because your query searched for words beginning with \"cat\". For patterns at the end of the line, you would use:\n\n\n\\\n \n\n\nor in TextWrangler,\n\n\n\\b\n\n\nagain.  The remainder of this walk-through imagines that you are using Notepad++, but if you\u2019re using Textwrangler, keep this quirk in mind. If you search for \n\n\ncat\\\n \n\n\nit will find \"cat\" and \"copycat\", but not \"catch,\" because your query searched for words ending with -\"cat\".\n\n\nRegular expressions can be mixed, so if you wanted to find words only matching \"cat\", no matter where in the sentence, you'd search for \n\n\n\\\ncat\\\n\n\nwhich would find every instance. And, because all regular expressions can be mixed, if you searched for (in Notepad++; what would you change, if you were using TextWrangler?)\n\n\n\\\ncat|dog\\\n\n\nand replaced all with \"animal\", you would have a document that replaced all instances of \"dog\" or \"cat\" with \"animal\", no matter where in the sentence they appear. You can also search for variations within a single word using parentheses. For example if you were looking for instances of \"gray\" or \"grey\", instead of the search query\n\n\ngray|grey\n\n\nyou could type \n\n\ngr(a|e)y\n\n\ninstead. The parentheses signify a group, and like the order of operations in arithmetic, regular expressions read the parentheses before anything else. Similarly, if you wanted to find instances of either \"that dog\" or \"that cat\", you would search for: \n\n\n(that dog)|(that cat)\n\n\nNotice that the vertical bar | can appear either inside or outside the parentheses, depending on what you want to search for.\n\n\nThe period character . in regular expressions directs the search to just find any character at all. For example, if we searched for:\n\n\nd.g\n \n\n\nthe search would return \"dig\", \"dog\", \"dug\", and so forth. \n\n\nAnother special character from our cheat sheet, the plus + instructs the program to find any number of the previous character. If we search for \n\n\ndo+g\n\n\nit would return any words that looked like \"dog\", \"doog\", \"dooog\", and so forth. Adding parentheses before the plus would make a search for repetitions of whatever is in the parentheses, for example querying \n\n\n(do)+g\n\n\nwould return \"dog\", \"dodog\", \"dododog\", and so forth.\n\n\nCombining the plus '+' and period '.' characters can be particularly powerful in regular expressions, instructing the program to find any amount of any characters within your search. A search for \n\n\nd.+g\n\n\nfor example, might return \"dried fruits are g\", because the string begins with \"d\" and ends with \"g\", and has various characters in the middle. Searching for simply \".+\" will yield query results that are entire lines of text, because you are searching for any character, and any amount of them.\n\n\nParentheses in regular expressions are also very useful when replacing text. The text within a regular expression forms what's called a group, and the software you use to search remembers which groups you queried in order of their appearance. For example, if you search for \n\n\n(dogs)( and )(cats)\n\n\nwhich would find all instances of \"dogs and cats\" in your document, your program would remember \"dogs\" is group 1, \" and \" is group 2, and \"cats\" is group 3. Notepad++ remembers them as \n\"\\1\"\n, \n\"\\2\"\n, and \n\"\\3\"\n for each group respectively.\n\n\nIf you wanted to switch the order of \"dogs\" and \"cats\" every time the phrase \"dogs and cats\" appeared in your document, you would type \n\n\n(dogs)( and )(cats)\n\n\nin the 'find' box, and \n\n\n\\3\\2\\1\n\n\nin the 'replace' box. That would replace the entire string with group 3 (\"cats\") in the first spot, group 2 (\" and \") in the second spot, and group 1 (\"dogs\") in the last spot, thus changing the result to \"cats and dogs\".\n\n\nThe vocabulary of regular expressions is pretty large, but there are many cheat sheets for regex online (one that we sometimes use is http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx.

There are a lot of carriage returns, line breaks, and white spaces in this document that will make our regex very complicated and will in fact break it periodically, if we try to work with it as it is. Instead, let us remove all new lines and whitespaces and the outset, and use regex to put structure back. To begin, we want to get the entire document into a single line:\n\n\nFind: \n\\n\n\nReplace with nothing.\n\n\nNotepad++ reports the number of lines in the document at the bottom of the window. It should now report lines: 1.\n\n\nLet\u2019s introduce line breaks to correspond with the original letters (ie, a line break signals a new letter), since we want to visualize the network of locations mentioned where we join places together on the basis of being mentioned in the same letter. If we examine the original document, one candidate for something to search for, to signal a new letter, could be  \nPERSON\n to \nPERSON\n but the named entity recognizer sometimes confuses persons for places or organizations; the object character recognition also makes things complicated.  Since the letters are organized chronologically, and we can see \u2018Digitized by Google\u2019 at the bottom of every page (and since no writer in the 1840s is going to use the word digitized) let\u2019s use that as our page break marker. For the most part, one letter corresponds to one page in the book. It\u2019s not ideal, but this is something that the historian will have to discuss in her methods and conclusions. Perhaps, over the seven hundred odd letters in this collection, it doesn\u2019t actually make much difference.\n\n\nFind: \n(digitized)\n\nReplace:\n\\n\\1\n\n\nYou now have on the order of 700 odd lines in the document. \n\n\nLet\u2019s find the locations and put them on individual lines, so that we can strip out everything else. \n\n\nFind: \n(LOCATION)(.\\*?)(LOCATION)\n\nReplace: \n\\n\\2\n\n\nIn the search string above, the \n.\\*\n would look for everything between the first \nlocation\n on the line and the last \nlocation\nin the line, so we would get a lot of junk. By using \n.\\*?\n we just get the text between \nlocation\nand the next \nlocation\n tag.\nW\ne need to replace the \n and \n from the location tags now, as those are characters with special meanings in our regular expressions. Turn off the regular expressions in notepad ++ by unticking the \u2018regular expression\u2019 box. Now search for \n, \n, and \\ in turn, replacing them with tildes:\n\n\nLOCATION\nTexas\n/LOCATION\n becomes \n~Texas~~~\n\n\nNow we want to delete in each line everything that isn\u2019t a location. Our locations start the line and are trailed by three tildes, so we just need to find those three tildes and everything that comes after, and delete. Turn regular expressions back on in the search window.\n\n\nFind: \n(~~~)(.*)\n\nReplace with nothing.\n\n\nOur marker for a new page in this book was the line that began with \u2018Digitized by\u2019. We need to delete that line in its entirety, leaving a blank line.\n\n\nFind: \n(Digitized)(.\\*)\n\nReplace: \n\\n\n\n\nNow we want to get those locations all in the same line again. We need to find the new line character followed by the tilde, and then delete that new line, replacing it with a comma:\n\n\nFind: \n(\\n)(~)\n\nReplace: \n,\n\n\nNow we remove extraneous blank lines.\n\n\nFind: \n\\s*$\n\nReplace with nothing. \n\n\nWe\u2019re almost there. Let\u2019s remove the comma that starts each line by searching for \n\n^,\n (remembering that the carat character indicates the start of a line) and replacing with nothing. Save this as 'cleaned-locations.csv' Congratulations!

Find:  blankspaceblankspace \nReplace: new-document  And now let\u2019s get those single blankspace lines excised:  Find  \\n(blankspace) \nReplace:   Now you have something that looks like this:  \nnew-document Houston Republic_of_Texas United_States Texas \nnew-document Texas \nnew-document United_States Town_of_Columbia \nnew-document United_States Texas \nnew-document United_States United_States_of_ Republic_of_Texas \nnew-document New_Orleans United_States_Govern \nnew-document United_States Houston United_States Texas united_states \nnew-document United_States New_Orleans United_States \nnew-document Houston United_States Texas United_States \nnew-document New_Orleans   Why not leave \u2018new-document\u2019 in the file? It\u2019ll make a handy marker. Let\u2019s replace the spaces with commas:  Find:        -a single space \nReplace:  ,    Save your work as a *.csv file. You now have a file that you can load into a variety of other platforms or tools to perform your analysis. Of course, NER is not perfect, especially when dealing with names like \u2018Houston\u2019 that were a personal name long before they were a place name.  REGEX on PC to Useful Output:  Open your tagged file in Notepad++.  There are a lot of carriage returns, line breaks, and white spaces in this document that will make our regex very complicated and will in fact break it periodically, if we try to work with it as it is. Instead, let us remove all new lines and whitespaces and the outset, and use regex to put structure back. To begin, we want to get the entire document into a single line:  Find:  \\n \nReplace with nothing.  Notepad++ reports the number of lines in the document at the bottom of the window. It should now report lines: 1.  Let\u2019s introduce line breaks to correspond with the original letters (ie, a line break signals a new letter), since we want to visualize the network of locations mentioned where we join places together on the basis of being mentioned in the same letter. If we examine the original document, one candidate for something to search for, to signal a new letter, could be   PERSON  to  PERSON  but the named entity recognizer sometimes confuses persons for places or organizations; the object character recognition also makes things complicated.  Since the letters are organized chronologically, and we can see \u2018Digitized by Google\u2019 at the bottom of every page (and since no writer in the 1840s is going to use the word digitized) let\u2019s use that as our page break marker. For the most part, one letter corresponds to one page in the book. It\u2019s not ideal, but this is something that the historian will have to discuss in her methods and conclusions. Perhaps, over the seven hundred odd letters in this collection, it doesn\u2019t actually make much difference.  Find:  (digitized) \nReplace: \\n\\1  You now have on the order of 700 odd lines in the document.   Let\u2019s find the locations and put them on individual lines, so that we can strip out everything else.   Find:  (LOCATION)(.\\*?)(LOCATION) \nReplace:  \\n\\2  In the search string above, the  .\\*  would look for everything between the first  location  on the line and the last  location in the line, so we would get a lot of junk. By using  .\\*?  we just get the text between  location and the next  location  tag.\nW\ne need to replace the   and   from the location tags now, as those are characters with special meanings in our regular expressions. Turn off the regular expressions in notepad ++ by unticking the \u2018regular expression\u2019 box. Now search for  ,  , and \\ in turn, replacing them with tildes:  LOCATION Texas /LOCATION  becomes  ~Texas~~~  Now we want to delete in each line everything that isn\u2019t a location. Our locations start the line and are trailed by three tildes, so we just need to find those three tildes and everything that comes after, and delete. Turn regular expressions back on in the search window.  Find:  (~~~)(.*) \nReplace with nothing.  Our marker for a new page in this book was the line that began with \u2018Digitized by\u2019. We need to delete that line in its entirety, leaving a blank line.  Find:  (Digitized)(.\\*) \nReplace:  \\n  Now we want to get those locations all in the same line again. We need to find the new line character followed by the tilde, and then delete that new line, replacing it with a comma:  Find:  (\\n)(~) \nReplace:  ,  Now we remove extraneous blank lines.  Find:  \\s*$ \nReplace with nothing.   We\u2019re almost there. Let\u2019s remove the comma that starts each line by searching for  ^,  (remembering that the carat character indicates the start of a line) and replacing with nothing. Save this as 'cleaned-locations.csv' Congratulations! You\u2019ve taken quite complicated output and cleaned it so that every place mentioned on a single page in the original publication is now on its own line, which means you can import it into a network visualization package, a spreadsheet, or some other tool!

Roman, October 29 1842\n\n\nIsaac Van Zandt, Anson Jones, January 11 1843\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nIn the previous module, we learned how to automatically grab text from sites like the Internet Archive. In this particular exercise today, we'll just copy and paste from the OCR'd text page (as we're working with a single document).\n\n\n\n\nCopy the OCR'd text from this file: http://archive.org/stream/diplomaticcorre33statgoog/diplomaticcorre33statgoog_djvu.txt\n\n\n\n\nand paste it into a new Notepad++ or Textwrangler file.

Pinckney Henderson, December 31, 1836 51\u2019 and ending with \u2018Wm. Henry Daingerfield to Ebenezer Allen, February 2, 1846 1582\u2019. Your file will now have approximately 2000 lines in it.\n\n\nNotice that there is a lot of text that we are not interested in at the moment: page numbers, headers, footers, or categories. We're going to use regular expressions to get rid of them. What we want to end up with is a spreadsheet that is arranged in three columns:\n\n\nSender, Recipient, Date\n\n\nScroll down through the text; notice there are many lines which don't include a letter, because they're either header info, or blank, or some other extraneous text. We're going to get rid of all of those lines. We want to keep every line that has this information in it: Sender to Recipient, Month, Date, Year, Page\n\n\nThe workflow\n\n\nWe start by finding every line that looks like a reference to a letter, and put a tilde (a ~ symbol) at the beginning of it so we know to save it for later. Next, we get rid of all the lines that don't start with tildes, so that we're left with only the relevant text. After this is done, we format the remaining text by putting commas in appropriate places, so we can import it into a spreadsheet and do further edits there.\n\n\nStep One\n\n\nIdentifying Lines that have Correspondence Senders and Receivers in them\n\n\nDiscussion\n Read in full before doing any manipulation of your text!\n\n\nIn Notepad++, press ctrl-f or search-\nfind to open the find dialogue box.  In that box, go to the 'Replace' tab, and check the radio box for 'Regular expression' at the bottom of the search box. In TextWrangler, hit command+f to open the find and replace dialogue box. Tick off the \u2018grep\u2019 radio button (which tells TextWrangler that we want to do a regex search) and the \u2018wraparound\u2019 button (which tells TextWrangler to search everywhere).\n\n\nRemember from our basic introduction that there's a way to see if the word \"to\" appears in full. Type\n\n\n\\\nto\\\n\n\nin the search bar.  Recall in TextWrangler we would look for \n\\bto\\b\n instead. This will find every instance of the word \"to\" (and not, for instance, also \u2018potato\u2019 or \u2018tomorrow\u2019).  \n\n\nWe don't just want to find \"to\", but the entire line that contains it. We assume that every line that contains the word \u201cto\u201d in full is a line that has relevant letter information, and every line that does not is one we do not need. You learned earlier that the query \n.+\n returns any amount of text, no matter what it says. Assuming you are using Notepad++, if your query is \n\n\n.+\\\nto\\\n.+\n \n\n\nyour search will return every line which includes the word \"to\" in full, no matter what comes before or after it, and none of the lines which don't. In TextWrangler, your query would be \n.+\\bto\\b.+.\n \n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we want to add a tilde ~ before each of the lines that look like letters, so we can save them for later. This involves the find-and-replace function, and a query identical to the one before, but with parentheses around it, so it looks like \n\n\n(.+\\\nto\\\n)\n\n\nand the entire line is placed within a parenthetical group. In the 'replace' box, enter \n\n\n~\\1\n\n\nwhich just means replace the line with itself (group 1), placing a tilde before it. \n\n\n\n\nCopy and past some of your text into [RegExr.com]. Write your regular expression (ie, what you're trying to find), and your substitution (ie, what you're replace with) in the RegExr interface. Once you're satisfied that you've got it right, run this on your working copy of your text. You might want to save with a new name at each step of this process, so that if something goes wrong, you can recover easily!\n\n\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\nRemoving Lines that Aren\u2019t Relevant\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nAfter running the find-and-replace, you should note your document now has most of the lines with tildes in front of it, and a few which do not. The next step is to remove all the lines that do not include a tilde. The search string to find all lines which don't begin with tildes is \n\n\\n[^~].+\n\n\nA \n\\n\n at the beginning of a query searches for a new line, which means it's going to start searching at the first character of each new line.  \nHowever, given the evolution of computing, it may well be that this won\u2019t quite work on your system\n. Linux based systems use \n\\n\n for a new line, while Windows often uses \n\\r\\n\n, and older Macs just use ``` \\r ````. These are the sorts of things that digital historians need to keep in mind! Since this will likely cause much frustration, your safest bet will be to save a copy of what you are working on, and then experiment to see what gives you the best result. In most cases, this will be:\n\n\n\\r\\n[^~].+\n\n\nWithin a set of square brackets \n[]\n the carrot \n^\n means search for anything that isn't within these brackets; in this case, the tilde \n~\n. The  \n.+\n as before means search for all the rest of the characters in the line as well. All together, the query returns any full line which does not begin with a tilde; that is, the lines we did not mark as looking like letters. \n\n\nBy finding all \n\\r\\n[^~].+\nand replacing it with nothing, you effectively delete all the lines that don't look like letters. What you're left with is a series of letters, and a series of blank lines. \n\n\n\n\nDevise the regular expression that works on your machine, and replace with nothing. Test on RegExr or on a smaller chunk of your text to make sure it works.\n\n\n\n\nStep Three\n\n\nRemoving the Blank Lines\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nGiven what we know about new lines, what do you think a regex would be for a blank line? Try that out in RegExr now. In Notepad++, it'll most likely be \n\\n\\r\n ; in textwrangler \n^\\r\n. Do you see what the difference is? Examine the cheat sheets and documentation at RegExr and make a note in your notebook on the difference.\n\n\n\n\nDevise the regular expression to find the blank lines, and replace with nothing. Are you still saving at each successful step?\n\n\n\n\nStep Four\n\n\nTransforming into CSV format\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nTo turn this text file into a spreadsheet, we'll want to separate it out into one column for sender, one for recipient, and one for date, each separated by a single comma. Notice that most lines have extraneous page numbers attached to them; we can get rid of those with regular expressions. There's also usually a comma separating the month-date and the year, which we'll get rid of as well. In the end, the first line should go from looking like:\n\n\n~Sam Houston to J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31, 1836 51\n\n\nto\n\n\nSam Houston, J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31 1836\n\n\nsuch that each data point is in its own column.\n\n\nYou will start by removing the page number after the year and the comma between the year and the month-date. To do this, first locate the year on each line by using the regex:\n\n\n[0-9]{4}\n\n\nAs a cheat sheet shows, \n[0-9]\n finds any digit between 0 and 9, and \n{4}\nwill find four of them together. Now extend that search out by appending \n.+\n to the end of the query; as seen before, it will capture the entire rest of the line. The query \n\n\n[0-9]{4}.+\n\n\nwill return, for example, \"1836 51\", \"1839 52\", and \"1839 53\" from the first three lines of the text. We also want to capture the comma preceding the year, so add a comma and a space before the query, resulting in \n\n\n, [0-9]{4}.+\n\n\nwhich will return \", 1836 51\", \", 1839 52\", etc.    \n\n\nThe next step is making the parenthetical groups which will be used to remove parts of the text with find-and-replace. In this case, we want to remove the comma and everything after year, but not the year or the space before it. Thus our query will look like:\n\n\n(,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)\n\n\nwith the comma as the first group \n\"\\1\"\n, the space and the year as the second \n\"\\2\"\n, and the rest of the line as the third \n\"\\3\"\n.  Given that all we care about retaining is the second group (we want to keep the year, but not the comma or the page number), what will the \nreplace\n look like?\n\n\n\n\nFind the dates using a regex, and replace so that only the \nsecond\n group in the expression is kept. You might want to consult the introduction to regex again before you execute this one.\n\n\n\n\nStep Five\n\n\nRemoving the tildes\n\n\n\n\nFind the tildes that we used to mark off our text of interest, and replace them with nothing to delete them.\n\n\n\n\nStep Six\n\n\nSeparating Senders and Receivers\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nFinally, to separate the sender and recipient by a comma, we find all instances of the word \"to\" and replace it with a comma. Although we used \n\\\n and \n\\\n(in TextWrangler, \n\\b\n) to denote the beginning and end of a word earlier in the lesson, we don't exactly do that here. We include the space preceding \u201cto\u201d in the regular expression, as well as the \n\\\n (\n\\b\n in TextWrangler) to denote the word ending. Once we find instances of the word and the space preceding it, \nto\\\n (nb, remember the space!!!) we replace it with a comma \n,\n.\n\n\n\n\nDevise the regex to find the word, and replace with a comma.\n\n\n\n\nStep Seven\n\n\nCleaning up\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nYou may notice that some lines still do not fit our criteria. Line 22, for example, reads \"Abner S. Lipscomb, James Hamilton and A. T. Bumley, AugUHt 15, \". It has an incomplete date; these we don't need to worry about for our purposes. More worrisome are lines, like 61 \"Copy and summary of instructions United States Department of State, \" which include none of the information we want. We can get rid of these lines later in Excel.  \n\n\nThe only non-standard lines we need to worry about with regular expressions are the ones with more than 2 commas, like line 178, \"A. J. Donelson, Secretary of State [Allen,. arf interim], December 10 1844\". Notice that our second column, the name of the recipient, has a comma inside of it. If you were to import this directly into Excel, you would get four columns, one for sender, two for recipient, and one for date, which would break any analysis you would then like to run. Unfortunately these lines need to be fixed by hand, but happily regular expressions make finding them easy. The query:\n\n\n.+,.+,.+,\n\n\nwill show you every line with more than 2 commas, because it finds any line that has any set of characters, then a comma, then any other set, then another comma, and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevise a regex to find these lines with more than 2 commas in them. Fix these lines manually, and then click 'find next' to grab the next one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of the file, add a new line that simply reads \"Sender, Recipient, Date\". These will be the column headers. Save as 'cleaned-correspondence.csv'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\n\nYou've now used regex to extract, transform, and clean historical text. As a csv file, you could now load this data into a network analysis program such as \nGephi\n to explore the ramifications of this correspondence network. Upload your file to your repository, and make a note of the original location of the file, the transformations that you've done, and the date/time. You will be using your 'cleaned-correspondence.csv' file in the next exercise using \nOpen Refine\n, where we'll sort out some of the messy OCR (fixing names, and so on).",

You will start by removing the page number after the year and the comma between the year and the month-date. To do this, first locate the year on each line by using the regex:  [0-9]{4}  As a cheat sheet shows,  [0-9]  finds any digit between 0 and 9, and  {4} will find four of them together. Now extend that search out by appending  .+  to the end of the query; as seen before, it will capture the entire rest of the line. The query   [0-9]{4}.+  will return, for example, \"1836 51\", \"1839 52\", and \"1839 53\" from the first three lines of the text. We also want to capture the comma preceding the year, so add a comma and a space before the query, resulting in   , [0-9]{4}.+  which will return \", 1836 51\", \", 1839 52\", etc.      The next step is making the parenthetical groups which will be used to remove parts of the text with find-and-replace. In this case, we want to remove the comma and everything after year, but not the year or the space before it. Thus our query will look like:  (,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)  with the comma as the first group  \"\\1\" , the space and the year as the second  \"\\2\" , and the rest of the line as the third  \"\\3\" .  Given that all we care about retaining is the second group (we want to keep the year, but not the comma or the page number), what will the  replace  look like?   Find the dates using a regex, and replace so that only the  second  group in the expression is kept. You might want to consult the introduction to regex again before you execute this one.   Step Five  Removing the tildes   Find the tildes that we used to mark off our text of interest, and replace them with nothing to delete them.   Step Six  Separating Senders and Receivers  Discussion  Finally, to separate the sender and recipient by a comma, we find all instances of the word \"to\" and replace it with a comma. Although we used  \\  and  \\ (in TextWrangler,  \\b ) to denote the beginning and end of a word earlier in the lesson, we don't exactly do that here. We include the space preceding \u201cto\u201d in the regular expression, as well as the  \\  ( \\b  in TextWrangler) to denote the word ending. Once we find instances of the word and the space preceding it,  to\\  (nb, remember the space!!!) we replace it with a comma  , .   Devise the regex to find the word, and replace with a comma.   Step Seven  Cleaning up  Discussion  You may notice that some lines still do not fit our criteria. Line 22, for example, reads \"Abner S. Lipscomb, James Hamilton and A. T. Bumley, AugUHt 15, \". It has an incomplete date; these we don't need to worry about for our purposes. More worrisome are lines, like 61 \"Copy and summary of instructions United States Department of State, \" which include none of the information we want. We can get rid of these lines later in Excel.    The only non-standard lines we need to worry about with regular expressions are the ones with more than 2 commas, like line 178, \"A. J. Donelson, Secretary of State [Allen,. arf interim], December 10 1844\". Notice that our second column, the name of the recipient, has a comma inside of it. If you were to import this directly into Excel, you would get four columns, one for sender, two for recipient, and one for date, which would break any analysis you would then like to run. Unfortunately these lines need to be fixed by hand, but happily regular expressions make finding them easy. The query:  .+,.+,.+,  will show you every line with more than 2 commas, because it finds any line that has any set of characters, then a comma, then any other set, then another comma, and so forth.    Devise a regex to find these lines with more than 2 commas in them. Fix these lines manually, and then click 'find next' to grab the next one.    At the top of the file, add a new line that simply reads \"Sender, Recipient, Date\". These will be the column headers. Save as 'cleaned-correspondence.csv'.    Congratulations!  You've now used regex to extract, transform, and clean historical text. As a csv file, you could now load this data into a network analysis program such as  Gephi  to explore the ramifications of this correspondence network. Upload your file to your repository, and make a note of the original location of the file, the transformations that you've done, and the date/time. You will be using your 'cleaned-correspondence.csv' file in the next exercise using  Open Refine , where we'll sort out some of the messy OCR (fixing names, and so on).",

            "text": "Twitter Archiving, or TWARC\n\n\nEd Summers\n is a software developer with feet firmly planted in the digital humanities world. He's currently at the Univeristy of Maryland, in the \nMaryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities\n. Recently, he has built a \npython tool\n for searching and grabbing tweets (and all their associated metadata, which is extremely rich), called '\nTwarc\n'.\n\n\nIn this optional exercise, you will install Twarc on your machine and use it to download all of the tweets hashtagged with '#hist3907b'. Once you've seen that it's working, you will then consider Twitter as a place for performing history. Perhaps you'll search for tweets related to a current event (the first draft of history, as the journalists used to call their work), perhaps you'll see what people are saying about a historic event, person, or place. Perhaps you'll try to map out how effective/affective those 'historical' twitter accounts are (like the ones that tweet WWII in 'real-time', or that purport to be the Emperor Hadrian).\n\n\n\n\nGetting set up\n\n\nThe first thing you'll need for this exercise is Python. Python is a programming language heavily used by historians and humanists. You will have noticed that many of the \nProgramming Historian\n tutorials are written in Python. We won't be writing any code; we just need Python on your machine so that your computer understands how to interpret Twarc commands.\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install \nPython\n version 2.7.9. (Twarc will use with Python 2 or 3, but I know it works with 2.7.9 because that's what I have installed on my own machine). Follow all prompts given to you by the installer.\n\n\nMake sure you have \nPip\n installed. \nNB\n Pip \nshould\n be installed when you installed Python - it's included by default in version 2.7.9 or above, so you should be ok (this note is aimed at those of you who already have Python). You can check, on the command line, if pip is installed with this command: \npip list\n. This will list every module you've got installed for Python - if Pip is installed, it'll be in the list.\n\n\nNext thing to do is to get the Twarc files from Summers' repository. Go to \nhttps://github.com/edsu/twarc\n and download as zip. Unzip somewhere easy-to-get-to on your machine. (As it happens, you can also type \npip install twarc\n from the command line to install it, but it won't give you the utilities folder you'll need later).\n\n\n\n\nTelling Twitter Who You Are\n\n\nTwarc works by interacting with Twitter's API. You need to set up authentication with Twitter, so that Twitter knows who you are when you start pinging them, asking for data. I assume you have a Twitter account? If not, you'll need to sign up for Twitter before you can proceed. Make sure you're logged into Twitter. Then,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to their \ndeveloper page and hit the button marked 'create a new app'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll be presented with a screen looking rather like this: \n . In 'name' you have to create a unique name for your Twarc - I've used \ntwarc-SMG\n for mine. In 'description' call it, 'twarc for my hist3907b class'. In 'website' give it the URL to your open notebook. Finally, you can leave 'call-back url' blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree to terms and conditions, prove you're a human, and click 'create application'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll then see a screen that looks like this; here I've already clicked on the 'keys and access tokens' tab: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET to a file on your computer; never share this file, don't upload it anywhere, don't put it in your open notebook.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Twarc\n\n\nTwarc will need that information you wrote down in the step above whenever it calls on Twitter. On a Mac, you can create a new file in the same folder where you unzipped Twarc and store your variables as a shell script. Its contents will look like this:\n\n\nexport CONSUMER_KEY=\nblah\n\nexport CONSUMER_SECRET=\nblah\n\nexport ACCESS_TOKEN=\nblah\n\nexport ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=\nblah\n\n\n\n\n\n....where \"blah\" is the relevant information (\nwith\n the quotation marks!), and you save this file as \nenviro.sh\n\n\nThen, open a terminal and navigate to your Twarc folder. Type:\n\n\nsource enviro.sh\n\n\nIf all goes well, nothing should appear to happen but for a new command prompt appearing.\n\n\nNon Mac users\n I'm testing solutions for how to do this in other environments. However, Twarc is smart enough that you can also just give it your credentials whenever you run a query, like so:\n\n\ntwarc.py --consumer_key foo --consumer_secret bar --access_token baz --access_token_secret bez --query ferguson\n\n\nso if you are on a mac, and can set the source as above, you don't need to tell twarc your credentials when you run a search. if you are NOT on a mac, you WILL have to do this.\n\n\nA Simple Search\n\n\nThe following would look for tweets concerning Ferguson (that is, tweets with the word or hashtag 'Ferguson', referencing the troubled town in Missouri):\n\n\ntwarc.py --query ferguson \n tweets.json\n\n\n(Keep in mind that PC \n Linux folks: pass your consumer key and secret etc as per the previous section, when you search).\nThis command tells your machine to run the code in the Twarc.py file, which asks Twitter to search and return all tweets with 'ferguson' in them, and then to write them to a file called 'tweets.json'. There might be a lot of tweets; this could take some time. (You might try to collect tweets related to Hist3907b instead, as that will be a \nmuch\n smaller dataset, just to see what's going on.)\n\n\nExtracting Geolocated tweets\n\n\nThere are a number of utilities for Twarc - see \nSummer's documentation here\n. One that you might be interested is the one for grabbing geolocated tweets.\n\n\nYou can output GeoJSON from tweets where geo coordinates are available:\n\n\nutils/geojson.py tweets.json \n tweets.geojson\n\n\nThis command tells your machine to look in the utils subfolder for a file called geojson.py and to run the code therein on your previously created json file with tweets in it. It filters that file and writes just the ones with location data into the geojson format. \n\n\n\n\nInstant Map!\n Github can recognize geojson and represent it on a map. In a new browser window, and assuming that you are logged into Github, go to \ngithub gist\n. Drag and drop your tweets.geojson file onto that browser window. Github will upload it. In the 'gist description' write 'geotagged tweets re ferguson'. Save. Instant, clickable, map!\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\nUse Twarc to collect a body of tweets that are historically interesting. Extract the geolocated ones and map them. Use some of the utilities to see if there is a difference between 'male' and 'female' tweeters (and how problematic might that be?). Convert your .json file to .csv and upload it to something like \nVoyant\n. Are there trends over time?\n\n\n(Incidentally, if you get an error message when trying to use one of the utilities, read the error message carefully. Is there something missing that the machine is looking for? \nI had such a problem just the other day\n Follow the link to see how to solve).",

You can now import your geocoded places into many other software packages. Gibbs also shows us how to convert our list into KML, the format that Google Earth and Google Maps can read.  Try it now . You can double-click on the resulting KML file, and if you have Google Earth installed, it will open up there. Within google earth, you can start adding more information, other annotations... pretty soon, you'll have a complete map!  Remember to upload your scripts   data   obersvations to your open notebook.  (Incidentally, if you wanted to load this material into  Palladio  you'd need a file that looked like this:  Place   Coordinates \nMEXICO  23.634501,-102.552784 \nCalifornia  36.778261,-119.4179324 \nBrazos  32.661389,-98.121667  etc: that is, a tab between 'place' and 'coordinates' in the first line, a tab between 'mexico' and the latitude, and a comma between latitude and logitude. Best way to effect this transformation? Probably using Regex. It's unfortunate that Palladio doesn't accept straightforward place,latitude,longitude comma separated data).",

            "text": "Working with Gephi\n\n\nBefore we go much further, I would recommend that you look at the work of Clement Levallois, who has a suite of excellent tutorials on working with Gephi at \nhttp://clementlevallois.net/gephi.html\n. The tutorial below is adapted from our open draft of \nThe Macroscope\n.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nGephi is quickly becoming the tool of choice for network analysts who do not need the full suite of algorithms offered by \nPajek\n or \nUCINET\n. It is relatively easy to use (eclipsed in this only by \nNodeXL\n), it is usable on all platforms, it can analyze fairly large networks, and it creates beautiful visualizations. The development community is also extremely active, with improvements being added constantly. We recommend Gephi for the majority of historians undertaking serious network analysis research. Gephi is available at http://gephi.github.io. Download and install it on your machine.\n\n\nWhen Not To Use Networks\n\n\nNetworks analysis can be a powerful method for engaging with a historical dataset but it is often not the most appropriate. Any historical database may be represented as a network with enough contriving but few should be. One could take the Atlantic trade network, including cities, ships, relevant governments and corporations, and connect them all together in a giant multipartite network. It would be extremely difficult to derive any meaning from this network, especially using traditional network analysis methodologies. Clustering coefficients (a useful network metric), for example, would be meaningless in this situation, as it would be impossible for the neighbors of any one node to be neighbors with one another. Network scientists have developed algorithms for \nmultimodal networks\n, but they are often created for fairly specific purposes, and one should be very careful before applying them to a different dataset and using that analysis to explore a historiographical question.\n\n\nNetworks, as they are commonly encoded, also suffer from a profound lack of nuance. It is all well to say that, because Henry Oldenburg corresponded with both Gottfried Leibniz and John Milton, he was the short connection between the two men. However, the encoded network holds no information of whether Oldenburg actually transferred information between the two or whether that connection was at all meaningful. In a flight network, Las Vegas and Atlanta might both have very high betweenness centrality because people from many other cities fly to or from those airports, and yet one is much more of a hub than the other. This is because, largely, people tend to fly directly back and forth from Las Vegas, rather than through it, whereas people tend to fly through Atlanta from one city to another. This is the type of information that network analysis, as it is currently used, is not well equipped to handle. Whether this shortcoming affects a historical inquiry depends primarily on the inquiry itself.\n\n\nWhen deciding whether to use networks to explore a historiographical question, the first question should be: to what extent is connectivity specifically important to this research project? The next should be: can any of the network analyses my collaborators or I know how to employ be specifically useful in the research project? If either answer is negative, another approach is probably warranted.\n\n\nTexan Correspondence\n\n\nYou will need the information you created in Module 3, after cleaning the correspondence data using Open Refine: \n\n\n\n\nIn order to get these data into Gephi, we will have to rename the \u201cSender\u201d column to \u201csource\u201d and the \u201cRecipient\u201d column to \u201ctarget\u201d. In the arrow to the left of Sender in the main OpenRefine window, select Edit column-\nRename this column, and rename the column \u201csource\u201d. Now, in the top right of the window, select \u201cExport-\nCustom tabular exporter.\u201d Notice that \u201csource,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d and \u201cDate\u201d are checked in the content tab; uncheck \u201cDate,\u201d as it will not be used in Gephi. Go to the download tab and change the download option from \u201cTab-separated values (TSV)\u201d to \u201cComma-separated values (CSV)\u201d and press download.   The file will likely download to your automatic download directory.\n\n\n\n\nQuick instructions for getting the data into Gephi:\n\n\nOpen Gephi by double-clicking its icon. Click \u201cnew project.\u201d The middle pane of the interface window is the \u201cData Laboratory,\u201d where you can interact with your network data in spreadsheet format. This is where we can import the data cleaned up in OpenRefine. \n\n\nIn the Data Laboratory, select \u201cImport Spreadsheet.\u201d Press the ellipsis \u201c...\u201d and locate the CSV you created. Make sure that the Separator is listed as \u201cComma\u201d and the \u201cAs table\u201d is listed as \u201cEdges table.\u201d Press \u201cNext,\u201d then \u201cFinish.\u201d\n\n\nYour data should load up. Click on the \u201coverview\u201d tab and you will be presented with a tangled network graph. Skip down to 'Navigating Gephi'.\n\n\nUmm, I never did manage that openrefine stuff...\n\n\nIn module 3, you used Notepad++ or Textwrangler, regular expressions, and OpenRefine to create a comma-separated value file (*.csv) of the diplomatic correspondence of the Republic of Texas. The final version of the file you created has a row for each letter listed in the volume, and in each row the name of the sender and the recipient. The file should look like this:\n\n\nsource,target\nSam Houston,J. Pinckney Henderson\nJames Webb,Alc6e La Branche\nDavid G. Burnet,Richard G. Dunlap\n\n...\n\n\nThis file is called 'an edge list' - it's a list of connections, or edges, between the individuals. If you no longer have the file, you can find it online \nhere\n. \n\n\nInstalling Gephi on OS 10 Mavericks\n\n\nMac users might have some trouble installing Gephi. We have found that, on Mac OS X Mavericks, Gephi does not load properly after installation. This is a Java-related issue, so you\u2019ll need to install an earlier version of Java than the one provided. To fix this, control click (or right-click) on the Gephi package, and select \u201cshow package contents.\u201d Click on \u201ccontents \n resources \n gephi \n etc.\u201d Control-click (or right-click) on \u201cgephi.conf\u201d and open with your text editor. Find the line reading:\n\n\n#jdkhome=\"/path/to/jdk\"\n\n\nand paste the following underneath:\n\n\njdkhome=\"/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n\nSave that file. Then, go to http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572 and install the older version of Java (Java 6). Once that is installed, Gephi should run normally.\n\n\nRun Gephi once it is installed. You will be presented with a welcome prompting you to open a recent file, create a new project, or load a sample file. Click \u201cNew Project\u201d and then click the \u201cData Laboratory\u201d tab on the horizontal bar at the top of the Gephi window (Fig. 7.3).\n\n\nNavigating Gephi\n\n\nGephi is broken up into three panes: Overview, Data Laboratory, and Preview. The Overview pane is used to manipulate the visual properties of the network: change colors of nodes or edges, lay them out in different ways, and so forth. The Overview pane is also where you can apply algorithms to the network, like those you learned about in the previous chapter. The Data Laboratory is for adding, manipulating, and removing data. Once your network is as you want it to be, use the Preview pane to do some final tweaks on the look and feel of the network and to export an image for publication.\n\n\nThere is one tweak that needs to done in the Data Table before the dataset is fully ready to be explored in Gephi. Click on the \u201cNodes\u201d tab in the Data Table and notice that, of the three columns, \u201cLabel\u201d (the furthermost field on the right) is blank in every row. This will be a problem when viewing the network visualization, as those labels are essential for the network to be meaningful. \n\n\nIn the \u201cNodes\u201d tab, click \u201cCopy data to other column\u201d at the bottom, select \u201cID\u201d, and press \u201cOk\u201d (Fig. 7.5). Upon doing so, the \u201cLabel\u201d column will be filled with the appropriate labels for each correspondent. While you\u2019re still in the Data Laboratory, look in the \u201cEdges\u201d tab and notice there is a \u201cWeight\u201d column. Gephi automatically counted every time a letter was sent from correspondent A to correspondent B and summed up all the occurrences, resulting in the \u201cWeight.\u201d This means that J. Pinckney Henderson sent three letters to James Webb, because Henderson is in the \u201cSource\u201d column, Webb in the \u201cTarget,\u201d, and the \u201cWeight\u201d is three.\n\n\nClicking on the Overview pane will take you to a visual representation of the network you just imported. In the middle of the screen, you will see your network in the \u201cGraph\u201d tab. The \u201cContext\u201d tab, at the top right, will show that you imported 234 nodes and 394 edges. At first, all the nodes will be randomly strewn across the screen and make little visual sense. Fix this by selecting a layout in the \u201cLayout\u201d tab \u2013 the best one for beginners is \u201cForce Atlas 2.\u201d Press the \u201cRun\u201d button and watch the nodes and edges reorganize on the screen into something slightly more manageable. After the layout runs for a few minutes, re-press the button (now labeled \u201cStop\u201d) to settle the nodes in their place. \n\n\nYou just ran a force-directed layout. Each dot is a correspondent in the network, and lines between dots represent letters sent between individuals. Thicker lines represent more letters, and arrows represent the direction the letters were sent, such that there may be up to two lines connecting any two correspondents (one for each direction).\n\n\nAbout two-dozen smaller components of the network will appear to shoot off into the distance, unconnected from the large, connected component in the middle. For the purpose of this exercise, we are not interested in those disconnected components, so the next step will be to filter them out of the network. The first step is to calculate which components of the network are connected to which others; do this by clicking \u201cRun\u201d next to the text that says \u201cConnected Components\u201d in the \u201cStatistics\u201d tab on the right-hand side.  Once there, select \u201cUnDirected\u201d and press \u201cOK.\u201d Press \u201cClose\u201d when the report pops up indicating that the algorithm has finished running.\n\n\nNow that this is done, Gephi knows which is the giant connected component and has labeled that component \u201c0\u201d. To filter out everything but the giant component, click on the \u201cFilters\u201d tab on the right-hand side and browse to \"Component ID Integer (Node)\" in the folder directory (you\u2019ll find it under \"Attributes,\" then \"Equal\"). Double-click \"Component ID Integer (Node)\" and click the \"Filter\" button at the bottom. Doing this removes the disconnected bundles of nodes.\n\n\nThere are many possible algorithms you could use for the analysis step, but in this case you will use the PageRank of  each node in the network . This measurement calculates the prestige of a correspondent according to how often others write to him or her. The process is circular, such that correspondents with high prestige will confer their prestige on those they write to, who in turn pass their prestige along to their own correspondents. For the moment let us take its results to equate with a correspondent\u2019s importance in the Republic of Texas letter network.\n\n\nCalculate the PageRank by clicking on the \"Run\" button next to \"PageRank\" in the \"Statistics\" tab. You will be presented with a prompt asking for a few parameters; make sure \"Directed\" network is selected and that the algorithm is taking edge weight into account (by selecting \"Use edge weight\"). Leave all other parameters at their default. Press \"OK\".\n\n\nOnce PageRank is calculated, if you click back into the \"Data Laboratory\" and select the \"Nodes\" list in the Data Table, you can see that a new \"PageRank\" column has been added, with values for every node. The higher the PageRank, the more central a correspondent is in the network. Going back to the Overview pane, you can visualize this centrality by changing the size of each correspondent\u2019s node based on its PageRank. Do this in the \"Ranking\" tab on the left side of the Overview pane.\n\n\nMake sure \"Nodes\" is selected, press the icon of a little red diamond, and select PageRank from the drop-down menu. In the parameter options just below, enter the \"Min size\" as 1 and the \"Max size\" as 10. Press \"Apply,\" and watch the nodes resize based on their PageRank. To be on the safe side and decrease clutter, re-run the \"Force Atlas 2\" layout as described above, making sure to keep the \"Prevent Overlap\" box checked.\n\n\nAt this point, the network is processed enough to visualize in the Preview pane, to finally begin making sense of the data. In Preview, on the left-hand side, select \"Show Labels,\" \"Proportional Size,\" \"Rescale Weight,\" and deselect \"Curved\" edges. Press \"Refresh.\" \n\n\nSo what have we got?\n\n\nThe visualization immediately reveals apparent structure: central figures on the top (Ashbel Smith and Anson Jones) and bottom (Mirabeau B. Lamar, James Webb, and James Treat), and two central figures who connect the two split communities (James Hamilton and James S. Mayfield). A quick search online shows the top network to be associated with the last president of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones; whereas the bottom network largely revolves around the second president, Mirabeau Lamar. Experts on this period in history could use this analysis to understand the structure of communities building to the annexation of Texas or they could ask meta-questions about the nature of the data themselves. For example, why is Sam Houston, the first and third president of the Republic of Texas, barely visible in this network?\n\n\nWrite up your own observations on this process in your open notebook, and export your gephi file as a .graphml file.

Going back to the Overview pane, you can visualize this centrality by changing the size of each correspondent\u2019s node based on its PageRank. Do this in the \"Ranking\" tab on the left side of the Overview pane.  Make sure \"Nodes\" is selected, press the icon of a little red diamond, and select PageRank from the drop-down menu. In the parameter options just below, enter the \"Min size\" as 1 and the \"Max size\" as 10. Press \"Apply,\" and watch the nodes resize based on their PageRank. To be on the safe side and decrease clutter, re-run the \"Force Atlas 2\" layout as described above, making sure to keep the \"Prevent Overlap\" box checked.  At this point, the network is processed enough to visualize in the Preview pane, to finally begin making sense of the data. In Preview, on the left-hand side, select \"Show Labels,\" \"Proportional Size,\" \"Rescale Weight,\" and deselect \"Curved\" edges. Press \"Refresh.\"",

Experts on this period in history could use this analysis to understand the structure of communities building to the annexation of Texas or they could ask meta-questions about the nature of the data themselves.

Trains, busses, Uber, metro - all of these can be combined into a 'transportation' network. Books, authors, editors, funders, censors, sponsors - a publishing network. Students, profs, classes, universities - an education network. Anytime you have more than one kind of \nthing\n (however defined) in your network, you formally have a bipartite (or tripartite, and so on, depending on the number of things) network. Visualizing such a network as nodes and edges can be a useful heuristic exercise. \n\n\nBut.\n\n\nIf you are doing this in Gephi, and you run some of Gephi's metrics (statistics) on a bipartite network, your results may not mean what you think they mean. The metrics, the algorithms assume 1-mode networks. Thus, running them on 2-mode (or more!) networks will result in ....issues.\n\n\n\n\nNow in truth, it's not quite so clear-cut to simply say, 'convert every bimodal network to unimodal before running any stats' (see \nScott's discussion here\n), but as a rule of thumb for when you're getting started, you'll be on much firmer methodological grounds if you transform your mutlimodal networks into a series of 1-mode networks. So convert every bimodal network to unimodal before running any statistics on your network(s).\n\n\nThus, this network: \n\nProfA -\n student1   (where -\n is a directed relationship, 'teaches')\n\nProfA -\n student2 \n\nProfB -\n student3 \n\nProbB -\n student1 \n\n\n...can be transformed into \ntwo\n networks, one where profA is connected to profB by virtue of a shared student (student1). That is, profs connected by students; and the inverse: students connected by profs. You could then run your metrics, and get two different perspectives on the educational dynamics of this particular university.\n\n\nIn this exercise, you'll transform a network of women and social organizations into two 1-mode networks.\n\n\nThe data\n\n\nThe data for this exercise comes from a former Carleton public history MA student, Peter Holdsworth. Peter lodged \na copy of his MA research on Figshare\n. Peter was interested in the social networks surrounding ideas of commemoration of the centenerary of the War of 1812, in 1912. He studied the membership rolls for women\u2019s service organization in Ontario both before and after that centenerary. By making his data public, Peter enables others to build upon his own research in a way not commonly done in history. (Peter can be followed on Twitter at \nhttps://twitter.com/P_W_Holdsworth\n).\n\n\nRight-click and 'save link' to get \nthe data files you'll need for this exercise\n\n\nConfiguring Gephi\n\n\nThere is a plugin for Gephi that we will use to transform our network. Open Gephi. Across the top of Gephi in the menu ribbon you\u2019ll see \nFile Workspace View Tools Window Plugins Help\n. \n\n\nTo get and install the plugin, select \nTools \n Plugins\n (The top level menu item 'Plugins' is empty and not used - a useful reminder that Gephi is still in \nbeta\n).\n\n\nIn the popup, under \u2018available plugins\u2019 look for \u2018MultimodeNetworksTransformation\u2019. Tick this box, then click on Install. Follow the instructions, ignore any warnings, click on \u2018finish\u2019. You may or may not need to restart Gephi to get the plugin running. If you suddenly see on the far right of ht Gephi window a new tab besid \u2018statistics\u2019, \u2018filters\u2019, called \u2018Multimode Network\u2019, then you\u2019re ok.\n\n\n\n\nImporting the data\n\n\n\n\nUnder \u2018file\u2019, select -\n New project.\n\n\nOn the data  laboratory tab, select Import-spreadsheet, and in the pop-up, make sure to select under \u2018as table: EDGES table. Select women-orgs.csv.  Click \u2018next\u2019, click finish.\n\n\n\n\nOn the data table, have \u2018edges\u2019 selected. This is showing you the source and the target for each link (aka \u2018edge\u2019). This implies a directionality to the relationship that we just don\u2019t know \u2013 so down below, when we get to statistics, we will always have to make sure to tell Gephi that we want the network treated as \u2018undirected\u2019. More on that below.\n\n\n\n\nLoading your csv file, step 1.\n\n\n\n\nLoading your CSV file, step 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \u2018copy data to other column\u2019. Select \u2018Id\u2019. In the pop-up, select \u2018Label\u2019. You now have your edges labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as you did above, now import NODES (Women-names.csv)\n\n\n\n\nmaking sure you're on the Nodes page in the data laboratory, copy ID to Label to that your nodes are labelled.\n\n\n\n\n(nb. You can always add more attribute data to your network this way, as long as you always use a column called Id so that Gephi knows where to slot the new information. Make sure to never tick off the box labeled \u2018force nodes to be created as new ones\u2019.)\n\n\nPrepping your data\n\n\nWe're now going to manipulate the data a bit in order to get it ready for the transformation. In this data, we have women, and we have organizations. We need to tell Gephi which rows are the organizations. In Peter's original data input phase, he decided to use a unique number for each woman so that he would minimize data entry errors (misspellings and so on), as well as control for the use of maiden and married names. Miss Eliza Smith might become, at a later date, Mrs. George Doe. In Peter's scheme, this is the same person (remember in module 3 in the TEI exercise how we dealt with such issues?).\n\n\n\n\nOn your NODES page in the data laboratory, add new column, make it boolean. Call it \u2018organization\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Filter box, type [a-z], and select Id \u2013 this filters out all the women. (What would you have to do to filter out the organizations? Remember, this is a regex search!)\n\n\nTick off the check boxes in the \u2018organization\u2019 columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I note a typo in the image above, 'a-b'. that should be, 'a-z').\n\n\nSave this as \nwomen-organizations-2-mode.gephi\n.\n\n\nPro tip\n: always export your data from gephi (file \n export) in .net or .graphml or .gefx format as the .gephi format (which is your only option under file \n save as) is unstable. That is, sometimes gephi won't read .gephi files! I did say this was \nbeta\n software).\n\n\nTransforming the network\n\n\nAt this point, you have a two mode network in gephi. You could click on the 'overview' panel and play with some of the layouts and begin to form impressions about the nature of your data. Remember though any metrics calculated at this point would be largely spurious. Let's transform this two-mode network so that we can explore how women are connected to other women via shared membership.\n\n\n\n\nOn the multimode networks projection tab,\n+ click load attributes.\n+ in \u2018attribute type\u2019, select organization\n+ in left matrix, select \u2018false \u2013 true\u2019 (or \u2018null \u2013 true\u2019)\n+ in right matrix, select \u2018true \u2013 false\u2019. (or \u2018true \u2013 null\u2019) (do you see why this is the case? what would selecting the inverse accomplish?)\n+ select \u2018remove edges\u2019 and \u2018remove nodes\u2019.\n+ Once you hit \u2018run\u2019, organizations will be removed from your bipartite network, leaving you with a single-mode network. hit \u2018run\u2019.\n+ save as \nwomen-to-women-network.gephi\n \nand\n export as \nwomen-to-women.net\n\n\nNB\n if your nodes data table is blank, your filter might still be active. make sure the filter box is clear. You should be left with a list of women (ie, a list of nodes where the identiers are numbers, per Peter's schema).\n\n\nAt this point, you could re-start Gephi and reload your \u2018women-organizations-2-mode.gephi\u2019 file and re-run the multimode networks projection so that you are left with an organization to organization network. Do this, and save and export with appropriate file names.\n\n\nExploring this network\n\n\nPeter's data has a number of \nattributes\n describing it, including the membership year. So let's see what this network of women looks like in 1902.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the filters tab at the right hand side of the Gephi interface, select \u2018attributes \u2013 equal\u2019 and then drag \u20181902\u2019 to the queries box.\n\n\nIn \u2018pattern\u2019 enter [0-9] and tick the \u2018use regex\u2019 box.\n\n\nclick ok, click \u2018filter\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have a network with 188 nodes and 8728 edges, showing the women who were active in 1902.\n\n\nLet\u2019s learn something about this network. Under the statistics tab at the right hand side of the Gephi interface,\n+ Run \u2018avg. path length\u2019 by clicking on \u2018run\u2019\n+ In the pop up that opens, select \u2018undirected\u2019 (as we know nothing about directionality in this network; we simply know that two women were members of the same organization at the same time. Note also that if the same pair were members of the more than one organziation, the weight of their connection will be corresponding stronger).\n+ click ok.\n+ run \u2018modularity\u2019 to look for subgroups. make sure \u2018randomize\u2019 and \u2018use weights\u2019 are selected. Leave \u2018resolution\u2019 at 1.0\n\n\nWe selected 'average path length' because one of the byproducts of this routine is 'betweeness centrality'. We're making an assumption here that a woman who has a high betweeness centrality score was in a position to affect information flow in 1902 society. Modularity looks at similar patterns of connections to cluster women who have more-or-less similar connections into groups.\n\n\nLet\u2019s visualize what we\u2019ve just learned.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \u2018partition\u2019 tab, over on the left hand side of the \u2018overview\u2019 screen, click on nodes, then click the green arrows beside \u2018choose a partition parameter\u2019.\n\n\nClick on \u2018choose a partition parameter\u2019. Scroll down to modularity class. The different groups will be listed, with their colours and their % composition of the network.\n\n\nHit \u2018apply\u2019 to recolour your network graph.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s resize the nodes to show off betweeness-centrality (to figure out which woman was in the greatest position to influence flows of information in this network.) \n\n\n\n\nClick \u2018ranking\u2019. (It's on the left hand side of the interface, beside 'partition' and just below 'overview'.\n\n\nClick \u2018nodes\u2019.\n\n\nClick the down arrow on \u2018choose a rank parameter\u2019. Select \u2018betweeness centrality\u2019.\n\n\nClick the red diamond. This will resize the nodes according to their \u2018betweeness centrality\u2019.\n\n\nClick \u2018apply\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nNow, down at the bottom of the middle panel, you can click the large black \u2018T\u2019 to display labels. Do so. Click the black letter \u2018A\u2019 and select \u2018node size\u2019.\n\n\nMrs. Mary Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound and Mrs. John Henry Wilson should now dominate your network (if you go back to the original data zip, you'll be able to find Peter's key to figure out who's who). Who were these ladies? What organizations were they members of? Who were they connected to? To the archives!\n\n\nCongratulations! You\u2019ve imported historical network data into Gephi, transformed it, manipulated it, and run some analyses. Play with the settings on \u2018preview\u2019 in order to share your visualization as svg, pdf, or png.\n\n\nNow go back to your original gephi file, and recast it as organizations to organizations via shared members, to figure out which organizations were key in early 20th century Ontario\u2026 make appropriate notes in your open notebook.",

Here's how you'd get this up and running.\n\n+ Go to the [github repo for bootleaf](https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf).\n+ Fork a copy to a new repo (you have to be logged into github.com) by hitting the 'fork' button. \n+ In your copy of bootleaf, you now have a gh-pages version of the site. If you go to ``` yourusername .github.io/bootleaf``` you should see an active version of the map.\n+ Now, the map is grabbing its data from a series of geojson files. You can use [this service](http://togeojson.com/) to convert your csv to geojson. There are other services.\n+ Clone your repository in your desktop (by pressing the clone your repo in desktop).\n+ Open your desktop client, and make sure you're in the gh-pages branch\n+ Using your windows explorer or mac finder, put your newly created geojson file in the data folder.\n+ commit and sync your changes.\n\nTo add your data to the dropdown menu, you need to change the code in the index.html file:\n\n```html\n   li class= dropdown \n                 a class= dropdown-toggle  id= downloadDrop  href= #  role= button  data-toggle= dropdown i class= fa fa-cloud-download white /i nbsp; nbsp;Download  b class= caret /b /a \n                 ul class= dropdown-menu \n                   li a href= data/boroughs.geojson  download= boroughs.geojson  target= _blank  data-toggle= collapse  data-target= .navbar-collapse.in i class= fa fa-download /i nbsp; nbsp;Boroughs /a /li \n                   li a href= data/subways.geojson  download= subways.geojson  target= _blank  data-toggle= collapse  data-target= .navbar-collapse.in i class= fa fa-download /i nbsp; nbsp;Subway Lines /a /li \n                   li a href= data/DOITT_THEATER_01_13SEPT2010.geojson  download= theaters.geojson  target= _blank  data-toggle= collapse  data-target= .navbar-collapse.in i class= fa fa-download /i nbsp; nbsp;Theaters /a /li \n                   li a href= data/DOITT_MUSEUM_01_13SEPT2010.geojson  download= museums.geojson  target= _blank  data-toggle= collapse  data-target= .navbar-collapse.in i class= fa fa-download /i nbsp; nbsp;Museums /a /li \n                 /ul   and since you probably don't want that other stuff, you could delete it.
